5</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>It is a delightful employment to discover and trace the 
operations of Divine grace, as they are manifested in the 
dispositions and lives of God&rsquo;s real children.&nbsp; It is 
peculiarly gratifying to observe how frequently, among the poorer
classes of mankind, the sunshine of mercy beams upon the heart, 
and bears witness to the image of Christ which the Spirit of God 
has impressed thereupon.&nbsp; Among such, the sincerity and 
simplicity of the Christian character appear unencumbered by 
those obstacles to spirituality of mind and conversation, which 
too often prove a great hindrance to those who live in the higher
ranks.&nbsp; Many are the difficulties which riches, worldly 
consequence, high connexions, and the luxuriant refinements of 
polished society, throw in the way of religious <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
6</span>profession.&nbsp; Happy indeed it is (and some such happy
instances I know), where grace has so strikingly supported its 
conflict with natural pride, self-importance, the allurements of 
luxury, ease, and worldly opinion, that the noble and mighty 
appear adorned with genuine poverty of spirit, self-denial, 
humble-mindedness, and deep spirituality of heart.</p>
<p>But in general, if we want to see religion in its most simple 
and pure character, we must look for it among the poor of this 
world, who are rich in faith.&nbsp; How often is the poor 
man&rsquo;s cottage the palace of God!&nbsp; Many can truly 
declare, that they have there learned the most valuable lessons 
of faith and hope, and there witnessed the most striking 
demonstrations of the wisdom, power, and goodness of God.</p>
<p>The character which the present narrative is designed to 
introduce to the notice of my readers, is given <i>from real life
and circumstance</i>.&nbsp; I first became acquainted with her by
receiving the following letter, which I transcribe from the 
original now before me:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rev. Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take the liberty to write to you.&nbsp; Pray excuse 
me, for I have never spoken to you.&nbsp; But I once heard you 
when you preached at --- <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Church.&nbsp; I believe you are a 
faithful preacher, to warn sinners to flee from the wrath that 
will be revealed against all those that live in sin, and die 
impenitent.&nbsp; Pray go on in the strength of the Lord.&nbsp; 
And may He bless you, and crown your labour of love with success,
and give you souls for your hire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord has promised to be with those whom He calls 
and sends forth to preach his Word to the end of time: for 
without Him we can do nothing.&nbsp; I was much rejoiced to hear 
of those marks of love and affection to that poor soldier of the 
S. D. Militia.&nbsp; Surely the love of Christ sent you to that 
poor man!&nbsp; May that love ever dwell richly in you by 
faith!&nbsp; May it constrain you to seek the wandering souls of 
men with the fervent desire to spend and be spent for his 
glory!&nbsp; May the unction of the Holy Spirit attend the word 
spoken by you with power, and convey deep conviction to the 
hearts of your hearers!&nbsp; May many of them experience the 
Divine change of being made new creatures in Christ!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, be fervent in prayer with God for the conviction 
and conversion of sinners.&nbsp; His power is great, and who can 
withstand it?&nbsp; He has promised to answer the prayer of 
faith, that is put up in his Son&rsquo;s name: &lsquo;Ask what ye
will, <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>it shall be granted you.&rsquo;&nbsp; How this should 
strengthen our faith, when we are taught by the Word and the 
Spirit how to pray!&nbsp; O that sweet inspiring hope! how it 
lifts up the fainting spirits, when we look over the precious 
promises of God!&nbsp; What a mercy if we know Christ, and the 
power of his resurrection in our own hearts!&nbsp; Through faith 
in Christ we rejoice in hope, and look in expectation of that 
time drawing near, when all shall know and fear the Lord, and 
when a nation shall be born in a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy time when Christ&rsquo;s kingdom shall 
come! then shall &lsquo;his will be done in earth, as it is in 
heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Men shall be daily fed with the manna of his
love, and delight themselves in the Lord all the day long.&nbsp; 
Then, what a paradise below they will enjoy!&nbsp; How it 
animates and enlivens my soul with vigour to pursue the ways of 
God, that I may even now bear some humble part in giving glory to
God and the Lamb!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I began to write this on Sunday, being detained 
from attending on public worship.&nbsp; My dear and only sister, 
living as a servant with Mrs ---, was so ill that I came here to 
attend in her place and on her.&nbsp; But now she is no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to intreat you to write to her in answer to
this, she being convinced of the evil of her past life, and that 
she had not walked in <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the ways of God, nor sought to please 
Him.&nbsp; But she earnestly desired to do so.&nbsp; This makes 
me have a comfortable hope that she is gone to glory, and that 
she is now joining in sweet concert with the angelic host in 
heaven to sing the wonders of redeeming love.&nbsp; I hope I may 
now write, &lsquo;Blessed are the dead which die in the 
Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She expressed a desire to receive the Lord&rsquo;s 
Supper, and commemorate his precious death and sufferings.&nbsp; 
I told her, as well as I was able, what it was to receive Christ 
into her heart; but as her weakness of body increased, she did 
not mention it again.&nbsp; She seemed quite resigned before she 
died.&nbsp; I do hope she is gone from a world of death and sin, 
to be with God for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I hope you will not be offended with me, a poor 
ignorant person, to take such a liberty as to write to you.&nbsp;
But I trust, as you are called to instruct sinners in the ways of
God, you will bear with me, and be so kind to answer this wrote 
letter, and give me some instructions.&nbsp; It is my 
heart&rsquo;s desire to have the mind that was in Christ, that 
when I awake up in his likeness, then I may be satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister expressed a wish that you might bury 
her.&nbsp; The minister of our parish, whither <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>she will be 
carried, cannot come.&nbsp; She will lie at ---.&nbsp; She died 
on Tuesday morning, and will be buried on Friday, or Saturday 
(whichever is most convenient to you), at three o&rsquo;clock in 
the afternoon.&nbsp; Please to send an answer by the bearer, to 
let me know whether you can comply with this request,</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your unworthy servant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth W---</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was much struck with the simple and earnest strain of 
devotion which this letter breathed.&nbsp; It was but 
indifferently written and spelt; but this rather tended to endear
the hitherto unknown writer, as it seemed characteristic of the 
union of humbleness of station with eminence of piety.&nbsp; I 
felt quite thankful that I was favoured with a correspondent of 
this description; the more so, as such characters were at this 
time very rare in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I have often wished 
that epistolary intercourse of this kind was more encouraged and 
practised among us.&nbsp; I have the greatest reason to speak 
well of its effect, both on myself and others.&nbsp; 
Communication by letter as well as by conversation with the pious
poor, has often been the instrument of animating and reviving my 
own heart in the midst of duty, and of giving me the most 
profitable information <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>for the general conduct of the 
ministerial office.</p>
<p>As soon as the letter was read, I inquired who was the bearer 
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is waiting at the outside of the gate, sir,&rdquo; 
was the reply.</p>
<p>I went out to speak to him, and saw a venerable old man, whose
long hoary hair and deeply-wrinkled countenance commanded more 
than common respect.&nbsp; He was resting his arm upon the gate, 
and tears were streaming down his cheeks.&nbsp; On my approach he
made a low bow, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have brought you a letter from my daughter; but 
I fear you will think us very bold in asking you to take so much 
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I shall be truly 
glad to oblige you and any of your family in this matter, 
provided it be quite agreeable to the minister of your 
parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, he told me yesterday that he should be very glad 
if I could procure some gentleman to come and bury my poor child 
for him, as he lives five miles off, and has particular business 
on that day.&nbsp; So, when I told my daughter, she asked me to 
come to you, sir, and bring that letter, which would explain the 
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I desired him to come into the house, and then said:</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>&ldquo;What is your occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have lived most of my days in a little cottage 
at ---, six miles from here.&nbsp; I have rented a few acres of 
ground, and kept some cows, which, in addition to my day-labour, 
has been the means of supporting and bringing up my 
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What family have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wife, now getting very aged and helpless, two sons 
and one daughter; for my other poor dear child is just departed 
out of this wicked world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope for a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, too, poor thing.&nbsp; She did not use to 
take to such good ways as her sister; but I do believe that her 
sister&rsquo;s manner of talking with her before she died, was 
the means of saving her soul.&nbsp; What a mercy it is to have 
such a child as mine is!&nbsp; I never thought about my own soul 
seriously till she, poor girl, begged and prayed me to flee from 
the wrath to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near seventy, and my wife is older; we are getting old,
and almost past our labour, but our daughter has left a good 
place, where she lived in service, on purpose to come home and 
take care of us and our little dairy.&nbsp; And a dear, dutiful, 
affectionate girl she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>&ldquo;Was she always so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir: when she was very young, she was all for the 
world, and pleasure, and dress, and company.&nbsp; Indeed, we 
were all very ignorant, and thought if we took care for this 
life, and wronged nobody, we should be sure to go to heaven at 
last.&nbsp; My daughters were both wilful, and, like ourselves, 
strangers to the ways of God and the Word of his grace.&nbsp; But
the eldest of them went out to service, and some years ago she 
heard a sermon at --- Church, by a gentleman that was going to 
---, as chaplain to the colony; and from that time she seemed 
quite another creature.&nbsp; She began to read the Bible, and 
became sober and steady.&nbsp; The first time she returned home 
afterwards to see us, she brought us a guinea which she had saved
from her wages, and said, as we were getting old, she was sure we
should want help; adding, that she did not wish to spend it in 
fine clothes, as she used to do, only to feed pride and 
vanity.&nbsp; She said she would rather show gratitude to her 
dear father and mother, because Christ had shown such mercy to 
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wondered to hear her talk, and took great delight in
her company; for her temper and behaviour were so humble and 
kind, she seemed so desirous to do us good both in soul <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and 
body, and was so different from what we had ever seen before, 
that, careless and ignorant as we had been, we began to think 
there must be something real in religion, or it never could alter
a person so much in a little time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her youngest sister, poor soul! used to laugh and 
ridicule her at that time, and said her head was turned with her 
new ways.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, sister,&rsquo; she would say; 
&lsquo;not my <i>head</i>, but I hope my <i>heart</i> is turned 
from the love of sin to the love of God.&nbsp; I wish you may one
day see, as I do, the danger and vanity of your present 
condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her poor sister would reply, &lsquo;I do not want to 
hear any of your preaching; I am no worse than other people, and 
that is enough for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sister,&rsquo; Elizabeth would say, 
&lsquo;if you will not hear me, you cannot hinder me from praying
for you, which I do with all my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, I believe those prayers are 
answered.&nbsp; For when her sister was taken ill, Elizabeth went
to Mrs ---&rsquo;s to wait in her place, and take care of 
her.&nbsp; She said a great deal to her about her soul, and the 
poor girl began to be so deeply affected, and sensible of her 
past sin, and so thankful for her sister&rsquo;s kind behaviour, 
that it gave her great hopes indeed <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>for her 
sake.&nbsp; When my wife and I went to see her, as she lay sick, 
she told us how grieved and ashamed she was of her past life, but
said she had a hope through grace that her sister&rsquo;s Saviour
would be her Saviour too; for she saw her own sinfulness, felt 
her own helplessness, and only wished to cast herself upon Christ
as her hope and salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, she is gone; and I hope and think her 
sister&rsquo;s prayers for her conversion to God have been 
answered.&nbsp; The Lord grant the same for her poor father and 
mother&rsquo;s sake likewise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation was a very pleasing commentary upon the 
letter which I had received, and made me anxious both to comply 
with the request, and to become acquainted with the writer.&nbsp;
I promised the good Dairyman to attend on the Friday at the 
appointed hour; and after some more conversation respecting his 
own state of mind under the present trial, he went away.</p>
<p>He was a reverend old man; his furrowed cheeks, white locks, 
weeping eyes, bent shoulders, and feeble gait, were 
characteristic of the aged pilgrim.&nbsp; As he slowly walked 
onwards, supported by a stick which seemed to have been the 
companion of many a long year, a train of <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>reflections 
occurred, which I retrace with pleasure and emotion.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour I arrived at the church, and after a 
little while was summoned to the churchyard gate to meet the 
funeral procession.&nbsp; The aged parents, the elder brother, 
and the sister, with other relatives, formed an affecting 
group.&nbsp; I was struck with the humble, pious, and pleasing 
countenance of the young woman from whom I had received the 
letter.&nbsp; It bore the marks of great seriousness without 
affectation, and of much serenity mingled with a glow of 
devotion.</p>
<p>A circumstance occurred during the reading of the burial 
service, which I think it right to mention, as one among many 
testimonies of the solemn and impressive tendency of our truly 
evangelical Liturgy.</p>
<p>A man of the village, who had hitherto been of a very careless
and even profligate character, went into the church through mere 
curiosity, and with no better purpose than that of vacantly 
gazing at the ceremony.&nbsp; He came likewise to the grave, and,
during the reading of those prayers which are appointed for that 
part of the service, his mind received a deep, serious conviction
of his sin and spiritual danger.&nbsp; It was an impression that 
never wore off, but gradually <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>ripened into 
the most satisfactory evidence of an entire change, of which I 
had many and long-continued proofs.&nbsp; He always referred to 
the burial service, and to some particular sentences of it, as 
the clearly ascertained instrument of bringing him, through 
grace, to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>The day was therefore one to be remembered.&nbsp; Remembered 
let it be by those who love to hear</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The short and simple annals of the 
poor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was there not a manifest and happy connection between the 
circumstances that providentially brought the serious and the 
careless to the same grave on that day together?&nbsp; How much 
do they lose who neglect to trace the leadings of God in 
providence, as links in the chain of his eternal purpose of 
redemption and grace!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While infidels may scoff, let us 
adore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the service was concluded, I had a short conversation 
with the good old couple and their daughter.&nbsp; She had told 
me that she intended to remain a week or two at the 
gentleman&rsquo;s house where her sister died, till another 
servant should arrive and take her sister&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be truly obliged,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;by an
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>opportunity of conversing with you, either there or at 
my father&rsquo;s, when I return home, which will be in the 
course of a fortnight at the farthest.&nbsp; I shall be glad to 
talk to you about my sister, whom you have just 
buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her aspect and address were highly interesting.&nbsp; I 
promised to see her very soon; and then returned home, quietly 
reflecting on the circumstances of the funeral at which I had 
been engaged.&nbsp; I blessed the God of the poor; and prayed 
that the poor might become rich in faith, and the rich be made 
poor in spirit.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>A sweet solemnity often possesses the mind, whilst retracing 
past intercourse with departed friends.&nbsp; How much is this 
increased, when they were such as lived and died in the 
Lord!&nbsp; The remembrance of former scenes and conversations 
with those who, we believe, are now enjoying the uninterrupted 
happiness of a better world, fills the heart with pleasing 
sadness, and animates the soul with the <!-- page 19--><a 
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>hopeful 
anticipation of a day when the glory of the Lord shall be 
revealed in the assembling of all his children together, never 
more to be separated.&nbsp; Whether they were rich or poor while 
on earth, is a matter of trifling consequence; the valuable part 
of their character is, that they are kings and priests unto God, 
and this is their true nobility.&nbsp; In the number of now 
departed believers, with whom I once loved to converse on the 
grace and glory of the kingdom of God, was the Dairyman&rsquo;s 
daughter.</p>
<p>About a week after the funeral I went to visit the family at 
---, in whose service the youngest sister had lived and died, and
where Elizabeth was requested to remain for a short time in her 
stead.</p>
<p>The house was a large and venerable mansion.&nbsp; It stood in
a beautiful valley at the foot of a high hill.&nbsp; It was 
embowered in fine woods, which were interspersed in every 
direction with rising, falling, and swelling grounds.&nbsp; The 
manor-house had evidently descended through a long line of 
ancestry, from a distant period of time.&nbsp; The Gothic 
character of its original architecture was still preserved in the
latticed windows, adorned with carved divisions and pillars of 
stone-work.&nbsp; Several pointed terminations also, in the 
construction of the roof, according to the <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>custom of our
forefathers, fully corresponded with the general features of the 
building.</p>
<p>One end of the house was entirely clothed with the thick 
foliage of an immense ivy, which climbed beyond customary limits,
and embraced a lofty chimney up to its very summit.&nbsp; Such a 
tree seemed congenial to the walls that supported it, and 
conspired with the antique fashion of the place to carry 
imagination back to the days of our ancestors.</p>
<p>As I approached, I was led to reflect on the lapse of ages, 
and the successive generations of men, each in their turn 
occupying lands, houses, and domains; each in their turn also 
disappearing, and leaving their inheritance to be enjoyed by 
others.&nbsp; David once observed the same, and cried out, 
&ldquo;Behold, thou hast made my days as an hand-breadth, and 
mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best 
state is altogether vanity.&nbsp; Surely every man walketh in a 
vain show; surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up 
riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them&rdquo; (Psal. 
xxxix. 5, 6).</p>
<p>Happy would it be for the rich, if they more frequently 
meditated on the uncertainty of all their possessions, and the 
frail nature of every earthly tenure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their inward 
thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their 
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>dwelling-places to all generations: they call their 
lands after their own names.&nbsp; Nevertheless, man being in 
honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.&nbsp; This
their way is their folly; yet their posterity approve their 
sayings.&nbsp; Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall
feed on them; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from 
their dwelling&rdquo; (Psal. xlix. 11-14).</p>
<p>As I advanced to the mansion, a pleasing kind of gloom 
overspread the front: it was occasioned by the shade of trees, 
and gave a characteristic effect to the ancient fabric.&nbsp; I 
instantly recollected that death had very recently visited the 
house, and that one of its present inhabitants was an 
affectionate mourner for a departed sister.</p>
<p>There is a solemnity in the thought of a recent death which 
will associate itself with the very walls, from whence we are 
conscious that a soul has just taken its flight to eternity.</p>
<p>After passing some time in conversation with the superiors of 
the family, in the course of which I was much gratified by 
hearing of the unremitted attention which the elder sister had 
paid to the younger during the illness of the latter.&nbsp; I 
received likewise other testimonies of the excellency of her 
general character and conduct in <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the 
house.&nbsp; I then took leave, requesting permission to see her,
agreeably to the promise I had made at the funeral, not many days
before.</p>
<p>I was shown into a parlour, where I found her alone.&nbsp; She
was in deep mourning.&nbsp; She had a calmness and serenity in 
her countenance, which exceedingly struck me, and impressed some 
idea of those attainments which a further acquaintance with her 
afterwards so much increased.</p>
<p>She spoke of her sister.&nbsp; I had the satisfaction of 
finding that she had given very hopeful proofs of a change of 
heart before she died.&nbsp; The prayers and earnest exhortations
of Elizabeth had been blessed to a happy effect.&nbsp; She 
described what had passed with such a mixture of sisterly 
affection and pious dependence on the mercy of God to sinners, as
convinced me that her own heart was under the influence of 
&ldquo;pure and undefiled religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She requested leave occasionally to correspond with me on 
serious subjects, stating that she needed much instruction.&nbsp;
She hoped I would pardon the liberty which she had taken by 
introducing herself to my notice.&nbsp; She expressed a trust 
that the Lord would overrule both the death of her sister and the
personal acquaintance with me that resulted from it, to a present
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>and future good, as it respected herself and also her 
parents, with whom she statedly lived, and to whom she expected 
to return in a few days.</p>
<p>Finding that she was wanted in some household duty, I did not 
remain long with her, but left her with an assurance that I 
proposed to visit her parents very shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I take it very kind that 
you have condescended to leave the company of the rich and 
converse with the poor.&nbsp; I wish I could have said more to 
you respecting my own state of mind.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall be 
better able another time.&nbsp; When you next visit me, instead 
of finding me in these noble walls, you will see me in a poor 
cottage.&nbsp; But I am happiest when there.&nbsp; Once more, 
sir, I thank you for your past kindness to me and mine, and may 
God in many ways bless you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quitted the house with no small degree of satisfaction, in 
consequence of the new acquaintance which I had formed.&nbsp; I 
discovered traces of a cultivated as well as a spiritual 
mind.&nbsp; I felt that religious intercourse with those of low 
estate may be rendered eminently useful to others, whose outward 
station and advantages are far above their own.</p>
<p>How often does it appear that &ldquo;God hath chosen the weak 
things of the world to confound <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the things 
which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which 
are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to 
bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in 
his presence&rdquo; (1 Cor. i. 27-29).</p>
<p>It was not unfrequently my custom, when my mind was filled 
with any interesting subject for meditation, to seek some spot 
where the beauties of natural prospect might help to form 
pleasing and useful associations.&nbsp; I therefore ascended 
gradually to the very summit of the hill adjoining the mansion 
where my visit had just been made.&nbsp; Here was placed an 
elevated sea mark: it was in the form of a triangular pyramid, 
and built of stone.&nbsp; I sat down on the ground near it, and 
looked at the surrounding prospect, which was distinguished for 
beauty and magnificence.&nbsp; It was a lofty station, which 
commanded a complete circle of interesting objects to engage the 
spectator&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Southward the view was terminated by a long range of hills, at
about six miles distance.&nbsp; They met, to the westward, 
another chain of hills, of which the one whereon I sat formed a 
link; and the whole together nearly encompassed a rich and 
fruitful valley, filled with cornfields and pastures.&nbsp; 
Through this vale winded a small river for many miles: much 
cattle were feeding <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>on its banks.&nbsp; Here and there 
lesser eminences arose in the valley, some covered with wood, 
others with corn or grass, and a few with heath or fern.&nbsp; 
One of these little hills was distinguished by a parish church at
the top, presenting a striking feature in the landscape.&nbsp; 
Another of these elevations, situated in the centre of the 
valley, was adorned with a venerable holly tree, which had grown 
there for ages.&nbsp; Its singular height and wide-spreading 
dimensions not only render it an object of curiosity to the 
traveller, but of daily usefulness to the pilot, as a mark 
visible from the sea, whereby to direct his vessel safe into 
harbour.&nbsp; Villages, churches, country-seats, farm-houses, 
and cottages were scattered over every part of the southern 
valley.&nbsp; In this direction, also, at the foot of the hill 
where I was stationed, appeared the ancient mansion, which I had 
just quitted, embellished with its woods, groves, and 
gardens.</p>
<p>South-eastward, I saw the open ocean, bounded only by the 
horizon.&nbsp; The sun shone, and gilded the waves with a 
glittering light that sparkled in the most brilliant 
manner.&nbsp; More to the east, in continuation of that line of 
hills where I was placed, rose two downs, one beyond the other, 
both covered with sheep, and the sea just visible over the 
farthest of them, as a terminating boundary.&nbsp; <!-- page 
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>In 
this point ships were seen, some sailing, others at anchor.&nbsp;
Here the little river, which watered the southern valley, 
finished its course, and ran through meadows into the sea, in an 
eastward direction.</p>
<p>On the north the sea appeared like a noble river, varying from
three to seven miles in breadth, between the banks of the 
opposite coast and those of the island which I inhabited.&nbsp; 
Immediately underneath me was a fine woody district of country, 
diversified by many pleasing objects.&nbsp; Distant towns were 
visible on the opposite shore.&nbsp; Numbers of ships occupied 
the sheltered station which this northern channel afforded 
them.&nbsp; The eye roamed with delight over an expanse of near 
and remote beauties, which alternately caught the observation, 
and which harmonised together, and produced a scene of peculiar 
interest.</p>
<p>Westward, the hills followed each other, forming several 
intermediate and partial valleys, in a kind of undulations, like 
the waves of the sea, and, bending to the south, completed the 
boundary of the larger valley before described, to the southward 
of the hill on which I sat.&nbsp; In many instances the hills 
were cultivated with corn to their very summits, and seemed to 
defy the inclemency of weather, which, at these heights, <!-- 
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>usually renders the ground incapable of bringing forth 
and ripening the crops of grain.&nbsp; One hill alone, the 
highest in elevation, and about ten miles to the south-westward, 
was enveloped in a cloud, which just permitted a dim and hazy 
sight of a signal-post, a lighthouse, and an ancient chantry, 
built on its summit.</p>
<p>Amidst these numerous specimens of delightful scenery I found 
a mount for contemplation, and here I indulged it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much of the natural beauties of Paradise still 
remain in the world, although its spiritual character has been so
awfully defaced by sin!&nbsp; But when Divine grace renews the 
heart of the fallen sinner, Paradise is regained, and much of its
beauty restored to the soul.&nbsp; As this prospect is compounded
of hill and dale, land and sea, woods and plains, all sweetly 
blended together and relieving each other in the landscape; so do
the gracious dispositions wrought in the soul produce a beauty 
and harmony of scene to which it was before a 
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked towards the village in the plain below, where the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s younger daughter was buried.&nbsp; I retraced 
the simple solemnities of the funeral.&nbsp; I connected the 
principles and conduct of her sister with the present probably 
happy state of her soul in the world of spirits, and was <!-- 
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>greatly impressed with a sense of the importance of 
family influence as a means of grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;That young 
woman,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;has been the conductor of not 
only a sister, but, perhaps, a father and mother also, to the 
true knowledge of God, and may, by Divine blessing, become so to 
others.&nbsp; It is a glorious occupation to win souls to Christ,
and guide them out of Egyptian bondage through the wilderness 
into the promised Canaan.&nbsp; Happy are the families who are 
walking hand in hand together, as pilgrims, towards the heavenly 
country.&nbsp; May the number of such be daily 
increasing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting my eye over the numerous dwellings in the vales on the
right and left, I could not help thinking, &ldquo;How many of 
their inhabitants are ignorant of the ways of God, and strangers 
to his grace!&nbsp; May this thought stimulate to activity and 
diligence in the cause of immortal souls!&nbsp; They are precious
in God&rsquo;s sight&mdash;they ought to be so in 
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some pointed and affecting observations to that effect 
recurred to my mind, as having been made by the young person with
whom I had been just conversing.&nbsp; Her mind appeared to be 
much impressed with the duty of speaking and acting for God 
&ldquo;while it is day,&rdquo; conscious that &ldquo;the night 
cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>Her laudable anxiety on this head was often testified to
me afterwards, both by letter and conversation.&nbsp; What she 
felt herself, in respect to endeavours to do good, she happily 
communicated to others with whom she corresponded or 
conversed.</p>
<p>Time would not permit my continuing so long in the enjoyment 
of these meditations, on this lovely mount of observation, as my 
heart desired.&nbsp; On my return home I wrote a few lines to the
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, chiefly dictated by the train of 
thought which had occupied my mind while I sat on the hill.</p>
<p>On the next Sunday evening I received her reply, of which the 
following is a transcript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rev. Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am this day deprived of an opportunity of attending 
the house of God to worship Him.&nbsp; But, glory be to his name!
He is not confined to time nor place.&nbsp; I feel Him present 
with me where I am, and his presence makes my paradise; for where
He is, is heaven.&nbsp; I pray God that a double portion of his 
grace and Holy Spirit may rest upon you this day; that his 
blessing may attend all your faithful labours; and that you may 
find the truth of his Word, assuring <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>us, that 
wherever we assemble together in his name, there He is in the 
midst to bless every waiting soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How precious are all his promises!&nbsp; We ought never
to doubt the truth of his Word; for He will never deceive us if 
we go on in faith, always expecting to receive what his goodness 
waits to give.&nbsp; Dear sir, I have felt it very consoling to 
read your kind letter to-day.&nbsp; I feel thankful to God for 
ministers in our Church who love and fear his name; there it is 
where the people in general look for salvation; and there may 
they ever find it, for Jesus&rsquo; sake!&nbsp; May his Word, 
spoken by you, his chosen vessel of grace, be made spirit and 
life to their dead souls.&nbsp; May it come from you as an 
instrument in the hands of God, as sharp arrows from a strong 
archer, and strike a death-blow to all their sins.&nbsp; How I 
long to see the arrows of conviction fasten on the minds of those
that are hearers of the word and not doers!&nbsp; O, sir! be 
ambitious for the glory of God and the salvation of souls: it 
will add to the lustre of your crown in glory, as well as to your
present joy and peace.&nbsp; We should be willing to spend and be
spent in his service, saying, &lsquo;Lord, may thy will be done 
by me on earth, even as it is by thy angels in 
heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you may expect to see his face with joy, 
and <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>say, &lsquo;Here am I, Lord, and all the souls thou hast
given me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems wonderful that we should neglect any 
opportunity of doing good, when there is, if it be done from love
to God and his creatures, a present reward of grace, in 
reflecting that we are using the talents committed to our care, 
according to the power and ability which we receive from 
Him.&nbsp; God requires not what He has not promised to 
give.&nbsp; But when we look back and reflect that there have 
been opportunities in which we have neglected to take up our 
cross, and speak and act for God, what a dejection of mind we 
feel!&nbsp; We are then justly filled with shame.&nbsp; Conscious
of being ashamed of Christ, we cannot come with that holy 
boldness to a throne of grace, nor feel that free access when we 
make our supplications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are commanded to provoke one another to love and 
good works; and where two are agreed together in the things of 
God, they may say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And if our fellowship below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jesus be so sweet,<br />
What heights of rapture shall we know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When round the throne we meet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I hope Mrs --- and you are both of one heart and 
one mind.&nbsp; Then you will sweetly <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>agree in all 
things that make for your present and eternal happiness.&nbsp; 
Christ sent his disciples out, not singly, but two and two, that 
they might comfort and help each other in those ways and works 
which their Lord commanded them to pursue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been my lot to have been alone the greatest part
of the time that I have known the ways of God.&nbsp; I therefore 
find it such a treat to my soul when I can meet with any who 
loves to talk of the goodness and love of God, and all his 
gracious dealings.&nbsp; What a comfortable reflection, to think 
of spending a whole eternity in that delightful 
employment&mdash;to tell to listening angels his love, 
&lsquo;immense, unsearchable!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir, I thank you for your kindness and 
condescension in leaving those that are of high rank and birth in
the world, to converse with me who am but a servant here 
below.&nbsp; But when I consider what a high calling, what honour
and dignity God has conferred upon me, to be called his child, to
be born of his Spirit, made an heir of glory, and joint heir with
Christ, how humble and circumspect should I be in all my ways, as
a dutiful and loving child to an affectionate and loving 
Father!&nbsp; When I seriously consider these things, it fills me
with love and gratitude to God, and I do not wish for any higher 
station, nor <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>envy the rich.&nbsp; I rather pity 
them if they are not good as well as great.&nbsp; My blessed Lord
was pleased to appear in the form of a servant, and I long to be 
like Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not feel in so happy a frame for conversation 
that day, nor yet that liberty to explain my thoughts, which I 
sometimes do.&nbsp; The fault must have been all in myself; for 
there was nothing in you but what seemed to evidence a Christian 
spirit, temper, and disposition.&nbsp; I very much wished for an 
opportunity to converse with you.&nbsp; I feel very thankful to 
God that you do take up the cross, and despise the shame: if you 
are found faithful, you will soon sit down with Him in glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have written to the Rev. Mr ---, to thank him for 
permitting you to perform the burial service at ---, over my dear
departed sister, and to tell him of the kind way in which you 
consented to do it.&nbsp; I should mention that your manner of 
reading the service on that day had a considerable effect on the 
hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse all faults, and correct my errors.&nbsp; I 
expect in a few days to return home to my parent&rsquo;s 
house.&nbsp; We shall rejoice to see you there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your humble servant in Christ,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>It was impossible to view such a correspondent with 
indifference.&nbsp; I had just returned from a little cottage 
assembly, where, on Sunday evenings, I sometimes went to instruct
a few poor families in one of the hamlets belonging to my 
parish.&nbsp; I read the letter, and closed the day with 
thanksgiving to God for thus enabling those who fear his name to 
build up each other in faith and love.</p>
<p>Of old time, &ldquo;they that feared the Lord spake often one 
to another: and the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of 
remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord,
and that thought upon his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That book of remembrance is not yet closed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>The mind of man is like a moving picture, supplied with 
objects not only from contemplation on things present, but from 
the fruitful sources of recollection and anticipation.</p>
<p>Memory retraces past events, and restores an <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>ideal reality
to scenes which are gone by for ever.&nbsp; They live again in 
revived imagery, and we seem to hear and see with renewed 
emotions what we heard and saw at a former period.&nbsp; 
Successions of such recollected circumstances often form a series
of welcome memorials.&nbsp; In religious meditations the memory 
becomes a sanctified instrument of spiritual improvement.</p>
<p>Another part of this animated picture is furnished by the 
pencil of Hope.&nbsp; She draws encouraging prospects for the 
soul, by connecting the past and present with the future.&nbsp; 
Seeing the promises afar off, she is persuaded of their truth, 
and embraces them as her own.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God gives a blessing to both these acts of the 
mind, and employs them in the service of religion.&nbsp; Every 
faculty of body and soul, when considered as a part of &ldquo;the
purchased possession&rdquo; of the Saviour, assumes a new 
character.&nbsp; How powerfully does the apostle, on this ground,
urge a plea for holy activity and watchfulness!&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your 
own?&nbsp; For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God 
in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&rsquo;s&rdquo; (1
Cor. vi. 19, 20).</p>
<p>The Christian may derive much profit and <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>enjoyment 
from the use of the memory, as it concerns those transactions in 
which he once bore a part.&nbsp; In his endeavours to recall past
conversations and intercourse with deceased friends in 
particular, the powers of remembrance greatly improve by 
exercise.&nbsp; One revived idea produces another, till the mind 
is most agreeably and usefully occupied with lively and holy 
imaginations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lull&rsquo;d in the countless chambers of 
the brain,<br />
Our thoughts are linked by many a hidden chain;<br />
Awake but one, and lo, what myriads rise!<br />
Each stamps its image as the other flies;<br />
Each, as the varied avenues of sense<br />
Delight or sorrow to the soul dispense,<br />
Brightens or fades: yet all with sacred art<br />
Control the latent fibres of the heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May it please God to bless, both to the reader and the writer,
this feeble attempt to recollect some of the communications I 
once enjoyed in my visits to the Dairyman&rsquo;s dwelling!</p>
<p>Very soon after the receipt of the last letter, I rode, for 
the first time, to see the family at their own house.&nbsp; The 
principal part of the road lay through retired, narrow lanes, 
beautifully overarched with groves of nut and other trees, which 
screened the traveller from the rays of the sun, and afforded 
many interesting objects for admiration <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>in the 
flowers, shrubs, and young trees which grew upon the high banks 
on each side of the road.&nbsp; Many grotesque rocks, with little
trickling streams of water occasionally breaking out of them, 
varied the recluse scenery, and produced a romantic and pleasing 
effect.</p>
<p>Here and there the most distant prospect beyond was observable
through gaps and hollow places on the road-side.&nbsp; Lofty 
hills, with navy signal-posts, obelisks, and lighthouses on their
summits, appeared at these intervals; rich cornfields were also 
visible through some of the open places; and now and then, when 
the road ascended a hill, the sea, with ships at various 
distances, was seen.&nbsp; But for the most part shady seclusion,
and objects of a more minute and confined nature, gave a 
character to the journey and invited contemplation.</p>
<p>How much do they lose who are strangers to serious meditation 
on the wonders and beauties of nature!&nbsp; How gloriously the 
God of creation shines in his works!&nbsp; Not a tree, or leaf, 
or flower, not a bird or insect, but it proclaims in glowing 
language, &ldquo;God made me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I approached the village where the good old Dairyman dwelt,
I observed him in a little field, driving his cows before him 
towards a yard and hovel which adjoined his cottage.&nbsp; I 
advanced <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>very near him without his observing 
me, for his sight was dim.&nbsp; On my calling out to him, he 
started at the sound of my voice, but with much gladness of heart
welcomed me, saying, &ldquo;Bless your heart, sir, I am very glad
you are come; we have looked for you every day this 
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage-door opened, and the daughter came out, followed 
by her aged and infirm mother.&nbsp; The sight of me naturally 
brought to recollection the grave at which we had before 
met.&nbsp; Tears of affection mingled with the smile of 
satisfaction with which I was received by these worthy 
cottagers.&nbsp; I dismounted, and was conducted through a neat 
little garden, part of which was shaded by two large 
overspreading elm trees, to the house.&nbsp; Decency and order 
were manifest within and without.&nbsp; No excuse was made here, 
on the score of poverty, for confusion and uncleanliness in the 
disposal of their little household.&nbsp; Everything wore the 
aspect of neatness and propriety.&nbsp; On each side of the 
fire-place stood an old oaken chair, where the venerable parents 
rested their weary limbs after the day&rsquo;s labour was 
over.&nbsp; On a shelf in one corner lay two Bibles, with a few 
religious books and tracts.&nbsp; The little room had two 
windows; a lovely prospect of hills, woods, and fields appeared 
<!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>through one; the other was more than half obscured by 
the branches of a vine which was trained across it; between its 
leaves the sun shone, and cast a cheerful light over the whole 
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;is a fit residence for 
piety, peace, and contentment.&nbsp; May I learn a fresh lesson 
for advancement in each, through the blessing of God, on this 
visit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the daughter, &ldquo;we are not worthy
that you should come under our roof.&nbsp; We take it very kind 
that you should travel so far to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Master,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;came a great deal 
farther to visit us poor sinners.&nbsp; He left the bosom of his 
Father, laid aside his glory, and came down to this lower world 
on a visit of mercy and love; and ought not we, if we profess to 
follow Him, to bear each other&rsquo;s infirmities, and go about 
doing good as He did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man now entered, and joined his wife and daughter in 
giving me a cordial welcome.&nbsp; Our conversation soon turned 
to the loss they had so lately sustained.&nbsp; The pious and 
sensible disposition of the daughter was peculiarly manifested, 
as well in what she said to her parents as in what she more 
immediately addressed to myself.&nbsp; I had now a further 
opportunity of <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>remarking the good sense and 
agreeable manner which accompanied her expressions of devotedness
to God and love to Christ, for the great mercies which He had 
bestowed upon her.&nbsp; During her residence in different 
gentlemen&rsquo;s families where she had been in service, she had
acquired a superior behaviour and address; but sincere piety 
rendered her very humble and unassuming in manner and 
conversation.&nbsp; She seemed anxious to improve the opportunity
of my visit to the best purpose for her own and her 
parents&rsquo; sake; yet there was nothing of unbecoming 
forwardness, no self-sufficiency or conceitedness in her 
conduct.&nbsp; She united the firmness and solicitude of the 
Christian with the modesty of the female and the dutifulness of 
the daughter.&nbsp; It was impossible to be in her company, and 
not observe how truly her temper and conversation adorned the 
principles which she professed.</p>
<p>I soon discovered how eager and how successful also she had 
been in her endeavours to bring her father and mother to the 
knowledge and experience of the truth.&nbsp; This is a lovely 
feature in the character of a young Christian.&nbsp; If it have 
pleased God, in the free dispensation of his mercy, to call the 
child by his grace, while the parent remains still in ignorance 
and sin, how <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>great is the duty incumbent on that 
child to do what is possible to promote the conversion of those 
to whom so much is owing.&nbsp; Happy is it when the ties of 
grace sanctify those of nature.</p>
<p>The aged couple evidently regarded and spoke of this daughter 
as their teacher and admonisher in Divine things, while at the 
same time they received from her every token of filial submission
and obedience, testified by continual endeavours to serve and 
assist them to the utmost of her power in the daily concerns of 
the household.</p>
<p>The religion of this young woman was of a highly spiritual 
character, and of no ordinary attainment.&nbsp; Her views of the 
Divine plan of saving the sinner were clear and scriptural.&nbsp;
She spoke much of the joys and sorrows which, in the course of 
her religious progress, she had experienced; but she was fully 
sensible that there is far more in real religion than mere 
occasional transition from one frame of mind and spirits to 
another.&nbsp; She believed that the experimental acquaintance of
the heart with God principally consisted in so living upon Christ
by faith, as to aim at living like Him by love.&nbsp; She knew 
that the love of God toward the sinner, and the path of duty 
prescribed to the sinner, are both of an unchangeable 
nature.&nbsp; In a believing <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>dependence on
the one, and an affectionate walk in the other, she sought and 
found &ldquo;the peace of God which passeth all 
understanding;&rdquo; &ldquo;for so He giveth his beloved 
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had read but few books besides her Bible; but these few 
were excellent in their kind, and she spoke of their contents as 
one who knew their value.&nbsp; In addition to a Bible and 
Prayer-book, &ldquo;Doddridge&rsquo;s Rise and Progress,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Romaine&rsquo;s Life, Walk, and Triumph of Faith,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim,&rdquo; &ldquo;Allein&rsquo;s 
Alarm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baxter&rsquo;s Saint&rsquo;s Everlasting 
Rest,&rdquo; a hymn-book, and a few tracts, composed her 
library.</p>
<p>I observed in her countenance a pale and delicate hue, which I
afterwards found to be a presage of consumption; and the idea 
then occurred to me that she would not live very long.</p>
<p>Time passed on swiftly with this interesting family; and after
having partaken of some plain and wholesome refreshment, and 
enjoyed a few hours&rsquo; conversation with them, I found it was
necessary for me to return homewards.&nbsp; The disposition and 
character of the parties may be in some sort ascertained by the 
expressions at parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God send you safe home again,&rdquo; said the aged 
mother, &ldquo;and bless the day that brought <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>you to see 
two poor old creatures, such as we are, in our trouble and 
affliction.&nbsp; Come again, sir, come again when you can; and 
though I am a poor ignorant soul, and not fit to talk to such a 
gentleman as you, yet my dear child shall speak for me; she is 
the greatest comfort I have left; and I hope the good Lord will 
spare her to support my trembling limbs and feeble spirits, till 
I lie down with my other dear departed kindred in the 
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust to the Lord,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and 
remember his gracious promise: &lsquo;Even to your old age I am 
He; and even to hoary hairs I will carry you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the daughter, &ldquo;for 
your Christian kindness to me and my friends.&nbsp; I believe the
blessing of the Lord has attended your visit, and I hope I have 
experienced it to be so.&nbsp; My dear father and mother will, I 
am sure, remember it; and I rejoice in the opportunity of seeing 
so kind a friend under this roof.&nbsp; My Saviour has been 
abundantly good to me in plucking me &lsquo;as a brand from the 
burning,&rsquo; and showing me the way of life and peace; and I 
hope it is my heart&rsquo;s desire to live to his glory.&nbsp; 
But I long to see these dear friends enjoy the power and comfort 
of religion likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it evident,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that the 
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>promise is fulfilled in their case: &lsquo;It shall come
to pass, that at evening time it shall be 
light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and praise God 
for the blessed hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Him too, that you have been the happy instrument 
of bringing them to the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir; yet, when I think of my own unworthiness and
insufficiency, I rejoice with trembling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the good old man, &ldquo;I am sure the
Lord will reward you for this kindness.&nbsp; Pray for us, old as
we are, and sinners as we have been, that yet He would have mercy
upon us at the eleventh hour.&nbsp; Poor Betsy strives much for 
our sakes, both in body and soul; she works hard all day to save 
us trouble, and I fear has not strength to support all she does; 
and then she talks to us, and reads to us, and prays for us, that
we may be saved from the wrath to come.&nbsp; Indeed, sir, she is
a rare child to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace be unto you and all that belong to 
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen, and thank you, dear sir,&rdquo; was echoed from 
each tongue.</p>
<p>Thus we parted for that time.&nbsp; My returning meditations 
were sweet, and, I hope, profitable.</p>
<p>Many other visits were afterwards made by me to this peaceful 
cottage, and I always found <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>increasing 
reason to thank God for the intercourse I there enjoyed.</p>
<p>An interval of some length occurred once during that year, in 
which I had not seen the Dairyman&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; I was 
reminded of the circumstance by the receipt of the following 
letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rev. Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been expecting to see or hear from you for a 
considerable time.&nbsp; Excuse the liberty I take in sending you
another letter.&nbsp; I have been confined to the house the 
greater part of the time since I left ---.&nbsp; I took cold that
day, and have been worse ever since.&nbsp; I walk out a little on
these fine days, but seem to myself to walk very near on the 
borders of eternity.&nbsp; Glory be to God, it is a very pleasing
prospect before me.&nbsp; Though I feel the workings of sin, and 
am abased, yet Jesus shows his mercy to be mine, and I trust that
I am his.&nbsp; At such times</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul would leave this heavy clay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At his transporting word,<br />
Run up with joy the shining way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet and prove the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fearless of hell and ghastly death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d break through every foe;<br />
The wings of love and arms of faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would bear me conqueror through.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>My desire is to live every moment to God, that I may 
through his grace be kept in that heavenly, happy frame of mind 
that I shall wish for at the hour of death.&nbsp; We cannot live 
nor die happy without this, and to keep it we must be continually
watching and praying: for we have many enemies to disturb our 
peace.&nbsp; I am so very weak, that now I can go nowhere to any 
outward means for that help which is so refreshing to my 
spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been very happy to have heard you last 
Sunday, when you preached at ---: I could not walk so far.&nbsp; 
I hope the Word spoken by you was made a blessing to many that 
heard it.&nbsp; It was my earnest prayer to God that it might be 
so.&nbsp; But, alas! once calling does not awaken many that are 
in a sound sleep.&nbsp; Yet the voice of God is sometimes very 
powerful when his ministers speak, when they are influenced by 
his Holy Spirit, and are simple and sincere in holding forth the 
Word of Life.&nbsp; Then it will teach us all things, and 
enlighten our mind, and reveal unto us the hidden things of 
darkness, and give us out of that Divine treasure &lsquo;things 
new and old.&rsquo;&nbsp; Resting on God to work in us both to 
will and to do of his good pleasure, we ought always to work as 
diligent servants, that know they have a good <!-- page 47--><a 
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Master, that 
will surely not forget their labour of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could but fix our eyes always on that crown of 
glory that awaits us in the skies, we should never grow weary in 
well-doing, but should run with patience, and delight in the work
and ways of God, where He appoints us.&nbsp; We should not then, 
as we too frequently do, suffer these trifling objects here on 
earth to draw our minds from God, to rob Him of his glory, and 
our souls of that happiness and comfort which the believer may 
enjoy amidst outward afflictions.&nbsp; If we thus lived more by 
faith on the Son of God, we should endeavour to stir up all whom 
we could to seek after God.&nbsp; We should tell them what He has
done for us, and what He would do for them if they truly sought 
Him.&nbsp; We should show them what a glorious expectation there 
is for all true believers and sincere seekers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our minds are so fixed on God, we are more 
desirous of glorifying Him, in making known his goodness to us, 
than the proud rich man is of getting honour to himself.&nbsp; I 
mourn over my own backwardness to this exercise of duty when I 
think of God&rsquo;s willingness to save the vilest of the vile, 
according to the dispensations of his eternal grace and 
mercy.&nbsp; Oh, how <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>amiable, how lovely does this make 
that God of love appear to poor sinners, that can view Him as 
such!&nbsp; How is the soul delighted with such a 
contemplation!&nbsp; They that have much forgiven, how much they 
love!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These thoughts have been much on my mind since the 
death of ---.&nbsp; I trust the Lord will pardon me for 
neglect.&nbsp; I thought it was my duty to speak or write to him;
you remember what I said to you respecting it.&nbsp; But I still 
delayed till a more convenient season.&nbsp; Oh, how I was struck
when I heard the Lord had taken him so suddenly!&nbsp; I was 
filled with sorrow and shame for having neglected what I had so 
often resolved to do.&nbsp; But now the time of speaking for God 
to him was over.&nbsp; Hence we see that the Lord&rsquo;s time is
the best time.&nbsp; Now the night of death was come upon him; no
more work was to be done.&nbsp; If I had done all that lay in my 
power to proclaim reconciliation by Christ to his soul, whether 
he had heard or no, I should have been more clear of his 
blood.&nbsp; But I cannot recall the time that is past, nor him 
from the grave.&nbsp; Had I known the Lord would have called him 
so suddenly, how diligent I should have been to warn him of his 
danger.&nbsp; But it is enough that God shows us what <i>we</i> 
are to do, and not what <i>He</i> is about to do with us or any 
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>of his creatures.&nbsp; Pray, sir, do all you can for 
the glory of God.&nbsp; The time will soon pass by, and then we 
shall enter that glorious rest that He hath prepared for them 
that love Him.&nbsp; I pray God to fill you with that zeal and 
love which He only can inspire, that you may daily win souls to 
Christ.&nbsp; May He deliver you from all slavish fear of man, 
and give you boldness, as He did of old those that were filled 
with the Holy Ghost and with power!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Christ hath promised to be with all his 
faithful ministers to the end of time.&nbsp; The greater dangers 
and difficulties they are exposed to, the more powerful his 
assistance.&nbsp; Then, sir, let us fear none but Him.&nbsp; I 
hope you will pray much for me a poor sinner, that God will 
perfect his strength in my weakness of body and mind; for without
Him I can do nothing.&nbsp; But when I can experience the 
teaching of that Holy One, I need no other teacher.&nbsp; May the
Lord anoint you with the same, and give you every grace of his 
Holy Spirit, that you may be filled with all the fulness of God; 
that you may know what is the height and depth, the length and 
breadth of the love of God in Christ Jesus; that you may be in 
the hand of the Lord, as a keen archer to draw the bow, while the
Lord directs <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>and fastens the arrows of conviction 
in the hearts of such as are under your ministry!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely pray that you may be made a blessing to him
that has taken the place of the deceased.&nbsp; I have heard that
you are fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; I hope you are, however, both as
strangers in this world, that have no abiding place, but seek a 
country out of sight.&nbsp; Pray excuse all faults,</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your humble servant in the bonds of the Gospel of 
Christ,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I perused this and other letters, which were at different
times written to me by the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, I felt that
in the person of this interesting correspondent were singularly 
united the characters of an humble disciple and a faithful 
monitor.&nbsp; I wished to acknowledge the goodness of God in 
each of these her capacities.</p>
<p>I sometimes entertain a hope that the last day will unfold the
value of these epistolary communications, beyond even any present
estimate of their spiritual importance.</p>
<h2><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>The translation of sinners &ldquo;from the power of darkness 
into the kingdom of God&rsquo;s dear Son,&rdquo; is the joy of 
Christians and the admiration of angels.&nbsp; Every penitent and
pardoned soul is a new witness to the triumphs of the Redeemer 
over sin, death, and the grave.&nbsp; How great the change that 
is wrought!&nbsp; The child of wrath becomes a monument of 
grace&mdash;a brand plucked from the burning!&nbsp; &ldquo;If any
man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed 
away; behold, all things are become new.&rdquo;&nbsp; How 
marvellous, how interesting is the spiritual history of each 
individual believer!&nbsp; He is, like David, &ldquo;a wonder 
unto many;&rdquo; but the greatest wonder of all to 
himself.&nbsp; Others may doubt whether it be so or not; but to 
him it is unequivocally proved, that, from first to last, grace 
alone reigns in the work of his salvation.</p>
<p>The character and privileges of real Christians are 
beautifully described in the language of our Church, which, when 
speaking of the objects of Divine favour and compassion, says: 
&ldquo;They that be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be
called according to God&rsquo;s purpose in due season; they 
through grace obey the calling: <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>they be 
justified freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be 
made like the image of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ: they 
walk religiously in good works; and at length, by God&rsquo;s 
mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a conception and display of the Almighty wisdom, power, 
and love, is indeed &ldquo;full of sweet, pleasant, and 
unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in 
themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ mortifying the 
works of the flesh, and their earthly members; and drawing up 
their minds to high and heavenly things: it doth greatly 
establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation, to be 
enjoyed through Christ, and doth fervently kindle their love 
towards God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly allied to the consolation of a good hope through grace,
as it respects our own personal state before God, is that of 
seeing its evidences shed lustre over the disposition and conduct
of others.&nbsp; Bright was the exhibition of the union between 
true Christian enjoyment and Christian exertion, in the character
whose moral and spiritual features I am attempting to 
delineate.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the first wish of her heart to prove to 
others, what God had already proved <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>to her, that 
Jesus is &ldquo;the Way, the Truth, and the Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
She desired to evince the reality of her calling, justification, 
and adoption into the family of God, by showing a conformity to 
the image of Christ, and by walking &ldquo;religiously in good 
works;&rdquo; she trusted that, in this path of faith and 
obedience, she should &ldquo;at length, by God&rsquo;s mercy, 
attain to everlasting felicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had the spiritual charge of another parish, adjoining to 
that in which I resided.&nbsp; It was a small district, and had 
but few inhabitants.&nbsp; The church was pleasantly situated on 
a rising bank, at the foot of a considerable hill.&nbsp; It was 
surrounded by trees, and had a rural, retired appearance.&nbsp; 
Close to the churchyard stood a large old mansion, which had 
formerly been the residence of an opulent and titled family; but 
it had long since been appropriated to the use of the estate as a
farm-house.&nbsp; Its outward aspect bore considerable remains of
ancient grandeur, and gave a pleasing character to the spot of 
ground on which the church stood.</p>
<p>In every direction the roads that led to this house of God 
possessed distinct but interesting features.&nbsp; One of them 
ascended between several rural cottages, from the sea-shore, 
which adjoined the lower part of the village street.&nbsp; 
Another winded round the curved sides of the adjacent <!-- page 
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>hill,
and was adorned both above and below with numerous sheep, feeding
on the herbage on the down.&nbsp; A third road led to the church 
by a gently rising approach, between high banks, covered with 
young trees, bushes, ivy, hedge-plants, and wild flowers.</p>
<p>From a point of land which commanded a view of all these 
several avenues, I used sometimes for a while to watch my 
congregation gradually assembling together at the hour of Sabbath
worship.&nbsp; They were in some directions visible for a 
considerable distance.&nbsp; Gratifying associations of thought 
would form in my mind, as I contemplated their approach, and 
successive arrival within the precincts of the house of 
prayer.</p>
<p>One day, as I was thus occupied, during a short interval 
previous to the hour of Divine service, I reflected on the joy 
which David experienced, at the time he exclaimed: &ldquo;I was 
glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the 
Lord.&nbsp; Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O 
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact 
together: whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto 
the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the Lord&rdquo; 
(Psa. cxxii. 1-4).</p>
<p>I was led to reflect upon the various blessings <!-- page 
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>connected with the establishment of public 
worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many immortal souls are now gathering 
together, to perform the all-important work of prayer and 
praise&mdash;to hear the Word of God&mdash;to feed upon the Bread
of Life!&nbsp; They are leaving their respective dwellings, and 
will soon be united together in the house of prayer.&nbsp; How 
beautifully does this represent the effect produced by the voice 
of &lsquo;the Good Shepherd,&rsquo; calling his sheep from every 
part of the wilderness into his fold!&nbsp; As these fields, 
hills, and lanes are now covered with men, women, and children, 
in various directions, drawing near to each other, and to the 
object of their journey&rsquo;s end: even so, many &lsquo;shall 
come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and 
from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of 
God&rsquo;&rdquo; (Luke xiii. 29).</p>
<p>Who can rightly appreciate the value of such hours as 
these?&mdash;hours spent in learning the ways of holy 
pleasantness and the paths of heavenly peace&mdash;hours devoted 
to the service of God and of souls; in warning the sinner to flee
from the wrath to come; in teaching the ignorant how to live and 
die; in preaching the Gospel to the poor; in healing the 
broken-hearted; in declaring &ldquo;deliverance to the captives, 
and recovering of sight to the blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed
is <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, 
O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.&nbsp; In thy name shall 
they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be 
exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My thoughts then pursued a train of reflection on the 
importance of the ministerial office, as connected in the 
purposes of God with the salvation of sinners.&nbsp; I inwardly 
prayed that those many individuals whom He had given me to 
instruct, might not, through my neglect or error, be as sheep 
having no shepherd, nor as the blind led by the blind; but rather
that I might, in season and out of season, faithfully proclaim 
the simple and undisguised truths of the Gospel, to the glory of 
God and the prosperity of his Church.</p>
<p>At that instant, near the bottom of the inclosed lane which 
led to the churchyard, I observed a friend, whom, at such a 
distance from his own home, I little expected to meet.&nbsp; It 
was the venerable Dairyman.&nbsp; He came up the ascent, leaning 
with one hand on his trusty staff, and with the other on the arm 
of a younger man, well known to me, who appeared to be much 
gratified in meeting with such a companion by the way.</p>
<p>My station was on the top of one of the banks <!-- page 
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>which
formed the hollow road beneath.&nbsp; They passed a few yards 
below me.&nbsp; I was concealed from their sight by a projecting 
tree.&nbsp; They were talking of the mercies of God, and the 
unsearchable riches of his grace.&nbsp; The Dairyman was telling 
his companion what a blessing the Lord had given him in his 
daughter.&nbsp; His countenance brightened as he named her, and 
called her his precious Betsy.</p>
<p>I met them at a stile not many yards beyond, and accompanied 
them to the church, which was hard by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I have brought a 
letter from my daughter: I hope I am in time for Divine 
service.&nbsp; Seven miles is now become a long walk for me: I 
grow old and weak.&nbsp; I am very glad to see you, 
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poorly, indeed, sir: very poorly.&nbsp; The 
doctors say it is a decline.&nbsp; I sometimes hope she will get 
the better of it; but then again I have many fears.&nbsp; You 
know, sir, that I have cause to love and prize her.&nbsp; Oh, it 
would be such a trial; but the Lord knows what is best.&nbsp; 
Excuse my weakness, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a letter into my hand, the perusal of which I reserved 
till afterwards, as the time was nigh for going into church.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>The presence of this aged pilgrim, the peculiar 
reverence and affection with which he joined in the different 
parts of the service, excited many gratifying thoughts in my 
mind; such as rather furthered than interrupted devotion.</p>
<p>The train of reflection in which I had engaged, when I first 
discovered him on the road, at intervals recurred powerfully to 
my feelings, as I viewed that very congregation assembled 
together in the house of God, whose steps, in their approach 
towards it, I had watched with prayerful emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the rich and poor meet together in mutual 
acknowledgment, that the Lord is the Maker of them all; that all 
are alike dependent creatures, looking up to one common Father to
supply their wants both temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, likewise, will they meet together in the grave, 
that undistinguished receptacle of the opulent and the needy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And once more, at the judgment-seat of Christ, shall 
the rich and the poor meet together, &lsquo;that every one may 
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath 
done, whether it be good or bad&rsquo;&rdquo; (2 Cor. v. 10).</p>
<p>&ldquo;How closely connected in the history of man are these 
three periods of a general meeting together!</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>&ldquo;The house of prayer&mdash;the house appointed for
all living&mdash;and the house not made with hands eternal in the
heavens.&nbsp; May we never separate these ideas from each other,
but retain them in a sacred and profitable union!&nbsp; So shall 
our worshipping assemblies on earth be representatives of the 
general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the congregation dispersed, I entered into discourse with
the Dairyman and a few of the poor of my flock, whose minds were 
of like disposition to his own.&nbsp; He seldom could speak long 
together without some reference to his dear child.&nbsp; He loved
to tell how merciful his God had been to him, in the dutiful and 
affectionate attentions of his daughter.&nbsp; All real 
Christians feel a tender spiritual attachment towards those who 
have been the instrument of bringing them to an effectual 
knowledge of the way of salvation: but when that instrument is 
one so nearly allied, how dear does the relationship become!</p>
<p>If my friend the Dairyman was in any danger of falling into 
idolatry, his child would have been the idol of his 
affections.&nbsp; She was the prop and stay of her parents&rsquo;
declining years, and they scarcely knew how sufficiently to 
testify the gratitude of their hearts, for the comfort and <!-- 
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>blessing which she was the means of affording them.</p>
<p>While he was relating several particulars of his family 
history to the others, I opened and read the following 
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Once 
more I take the liberty to trouble you with a few lines.&nbsp; I 
received your letter with great pleasure, and thank you for 
it.&nbsp; I am now so weak, that I am unable to walk to any 
public place of Divine worship: a privilege which has heretofore 
always so much strengthened and refreshed me.&nbsp; I used to go 
in anxious expectation to meet my God, and hold sweet communion 
with Him, and I was seldom disappointed.&nbsp; In the means of 
grace, all the channels of Divine mercy are open to every heart 
that is lifted up to receive out of that Divine fulness grace for
grace.&nbsp; These are the times of refreshing from the presence 
of the Lord.&nbsp; How have I rejoiced to hear a faithful and 
lively messenger, just come, as it were, from communion with God 
at the throne of grace, with his heart warmed and filled with 
Divine love, to speak to fallen sinners!&nbsp; Such an one has 
seemed to me as if his face shone as that of Moses did with the 
glory of God, when he came down from the mount, where he had been
within the veil.&nbsp; <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>May you, sir, imitate him, as he did 
Christ, that all may see and know that the Lord dwelleth with 
you, and that you dwell in Him through the unity of the blessed 
Spirit.&nbsp; I trust you are no stranger to his Divine teaching,
aid, and assistance, in all you set your hand to do for the glory
of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, the sincerity of my wishes for your 
spiritual welfare will plead an excuse for the freedom of my 
address to you.&nbsp; I pray the Giver of every perfect gift, 
that you may experience the mighty workings of his gracious 
Spirit in your heart and your ministry, and rest your all on the 
justifying and purifying blood of an expiring Redeemer.&nbsp; 
Then will you triumph in his strength, and be enabled to say with
the poet:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I through fear of feeble men,<br />
The Spirit&rsquo;s course strive to restrain?<br />
Or, undismay&rsquo;d in deed and word,<br />
Be a true witness for my Lord?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Awed by a mortal&rsquo;s frown, shall I<br />
Conceal the word of God most high!<br />
How then before Thee shall I dare<br />
To stand? or, how thine anger bear?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I, to soothe the unholy throng,<br />
Soften thy truths and smooth my tongue,<br />
To gain earth&rsquo;s gilded toys, or flee<br />
The cross endur&rsquo;d, my God, by Thee!</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>&lsquo;What then is he whose scorn I dread,<br />
Whose wrath or hate makes me afraid?<br />
A man! an heir of death! a slave<br />
To sin! a bubble on the wave!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, let men rage, since Thou wilt spread<br />
Thy shadowing wings around my head:<br />
Since in all pain, thy tender love<br />
Will still my sure refreshment prove.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still shall the love of Christ constrain<br />
To seek the wand&rsquo;ring souls of men;<br />
With cries, entreaties, tears to save,<br />
And snatch them from the yawning grave.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For this, let men revile my name,<br />
No cross I shun, I fear no shame:<br />
All hail reproach, and welcome pain,<br />
Only thy terrors, Lord, restrain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust, sir, that you see what a glorious high calling
yours is, and that you are one of those who walk humbly with God,
that you may be taught of Him in all things.&nbsp; Persons in 
your place are messengers of the Most High God.&nbsp; Is it too 
much to say, they should live like the angels in all holiness, 
and be filled with love and zeal for men&rsquo;s souls?&nbsp; 
They are ambassadors in Christ&rsquo;s stead to persuade sinners 
to be reconciled to God.&nbsp; So that your calling is above that
of angels: for they are <i>afterward</i> to minister to the heirs
of salvation; but the sinner must be <!-- page 63--><a 
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span><i>first</i> 
reconciled to God.&nbsp; And you are called on from day to day to
intercede with man as his friend, that you may win souls to 
Christ.&nbsp; Christ is ascended up on high, to intercede with 
his Father for guilty sinners, and to plead for them the merits 
of his death.&nbsp; So that Christ and his faithful ministers, 
through the operation of the blessed Spirit, are co-workers 
together.&nbsp; Yet without Him we can do nothing: our strength 
is his strength, and his is all the glory from first to last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my heart&rsquo;s prayer and desire, sir, that you
may, by a living faith, cleave close to that blessed exalted Lamb
of God, who died to redeem us from sin&mdash;that you may have a 
sweet communion with Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;that you may 
sink deep in love and rise high in the life of God.&nbsp; Thus 
will you have such discoveries of the beauties of Christ and his 
eternal glory, as will fill your heart with true delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am not deceived, I wish myself to enjoy his 
gracious favour, more than all the treasures which earth can 
afford.&nbsp; I would, in comparison, look upon them with holy 
disdain, and as not worth an anxious thought, that they may not 
have power on my heart, to draw or attract it from God, who is 
worthy of my highest esteem, and of all my affections.&nbsp; It 
should be our <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>endeavour to set Him always before 
us, that in all things we may act as in his immediate presence; 
that we may be filled with that holy fear, so that we may not 
dare wilfully to sin against Him.&nbsp; We should earnestly 
entreat the Lord to mortify the power and working of sin and 
unbelief within, by making Christ appear more and more precious 
in our eyes, and more dear to our hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fills my heart with thankful recollections, while I 
attempt in this weak manner to speak of God&rsquo;s love to 
man.&nbsp; When I reflect on my past sins and his past mercies, I
am assured, that if I had all the gifts of wise men and angels, I
could never sufficiently describe my own inward sense of his 
undeserved love towards me.&nbsp; We can better enjoy these 
glorious apprehensions in our hearts, than explain them to 
others.&nbsp; But oh how unworthy of them all are we?&nbsp; 
Consciousness of my own corruptions keeps me often low; yet faith
and desire will easily mount on high, beseeching God that He 
would, according to the apostle&rsquo;s prayer, fill me with all 
his communicable fulness, in the gifts and graces of his Spirit; 
that I may walk well-pleasing before Him, in all holy 
conversation, perfecting holiness in his fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I err in boldness, sir, pray pardon me; <!-- page 
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and 
in your next letter confirm my hope, that you will be my 
counsellor and guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only recompense your kindness to me by my 
prayers, that your own intercourse with God may be abundantly 
blessed to you and yours.&nbsp; I consider the Saviour saying to 
you, as He did to Peter, &lsquo;Lovest them me?&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
may your heartfelt experience be compelled to reply, &lsquo;Thou 
knowest all things, and thou knowest that I love thee 
supremely.&rsquo;&nbsp; May He have evident marks of it in all 
your outward actions of love and humanity, in feeding his flock, 
and in the inward fervour and affection of all your consecrated 
powers; that you may be zealously engaged in pulling down the 
strongholds of sin and Satan, and building up his Church, sowing 
the seeds of righteousness, and praying God to give the increase;
that you may not labour for Him in vain, but may see the trees 
bud and blossom, and bring forth fruit abundantly, to the praise 
and glory of your heavenly Master.&nbsp; In order to give you 
encouragement, He says, &lsquo;Whosoever converteth a sinner from
the error of his way, shall save a soul from death;&rsquo; and 
that will increase the brightness of your crown in glory.&nbsp; 
This hath Christ merited for his faithful ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, you will receive grace to be <!-- page 
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>sincere in reproving sin, wherever you see it.&nbsp; You
will find Divine assistance, and all fear and shame will be taken
from you.&nbsp; Great peace will be given to you, and wisdom, 
strength, and courage, according to your work.&nbsp; You will be 
as Paul: having much learning, you can speak to men in all 
stations of life, by God&rsquo;s assistance.&nbsp; The fear of 
offending them will never prevent you, when you consider the 
glory of God; and man&rsquo;s immortal soul is of more value than
his present favour and esteem.&nbsp; In particular, you are in an
office wherein you can visit <i>all</i> the sick.&nbsp; 
Man&rsquo;s extremity is often God&rsquo;s opportunity.&nbsp; In 
this way you may prove an instrument in his hand to do his 
work.&nbsp; Although He <i>can</i> work without means, yet his 
usual way is by means; and I trust you are a chosen vessel unto 
Him, to prove his name and declare his truth to all men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visiting the sick is a strict command, and a duty for 
every Christian.&nbsp; None can tell what good may be done.&nbsp;
I wish it was never neglected, as it too often is.&nbsp; Many 
think that, if they attend the Church&mdash;the minister to 
preach and the people to hear&mdash;their duty is done.&nbsp; But
more is required than this.&nbsp; May the Lord stir up the gift 
that is in his people and ministers, that they may have 
compassion on their fellow-sinners, <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>that they may
never think it too late, but remember that while there is life 
there is hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more, I pray, sir, pardon and excuse all my errors
in judgment, and the ignorance that this is penned in; and may 
God bless you in all things, and particularly your friendship to 
me and my parents.&nbsp; What a comfort is family religion.&nbsp;
I do not doubt but this is your desire, as it is mine, to 
say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I and my house will serve the Lord,<br />
But first obedient to his word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I must myself appear:<br />
By actions, words, and temper show<br />
That I my heavenly Master know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And serve with heart sincere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must the fair example set;<br />
From those that on my pleasure wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stumbling-block remove;<br />
Their duty by my life explain,<br />
And still in all my works maintain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dignity of love.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Easy to be entreated, mild,<br />
Quickly appeas&rsquo;d and reconciled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower of my God:<br />
A saint indeed I long to be,<br />
And lead my faithful family<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the celestial road.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>&lsquo;Lord, if thou dost the wish infuse,<br />
A vessel fitted for thy use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into thy hands receive:<br />
Work in me both to will and do,<br />
And show them how believers true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And real Christians live.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all-sufficient grace supply,<br />
And then I&rsquo;ll come to testify<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wonders of thy name,<br />
Which saves from sin, the world, and hell,<br />
Its power may every sinner feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every tongue proclaim!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cleans&rsquo;d by the blood of Christ from sin,<br />
I seek my relatives to win,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And preach their sins forgiven;<br />
Children, and wife, and servants seize,<br />
And through the paths of pleasantness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct them all to heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living so much in a solitary way, books are my 
companions; and poetry, which speaks of the love of God and the 
mercies of Christ, is very sweet to my mind.&nbsp; This must be 
my excuse for troubling you to read verses which others have 
written.&nbsp; I have intended, if my declining state of health 
permit, to go to --- for a few days.&nbsp; I say this, lest you 
should call in expectation of seeing me, during any part of next 
week.&nbsp; But my dear father and mother, for <!-- page 69--><a 
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>whose 
precious souls I am very anxious, will reap the benefit of your 
visit at all events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your humble and unworthy servant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having read it, I said to the father of my highly valued 
correspondent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for being the bearer of this letter; your 
daughter is a kind friend and faithful counsellor to me, as well 
as to you.&nbsp; Tell her how highly I esteem her friendship, and
that I feel truly obliged for the many excellent sentiments which
she has here expressed.&nbsp; Give her my blessing, and assure 
her that the oftener she writes, the more thankful I shall 
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dairyman&rsquo;s enlivened eye gleamed with pleasure as I 
spoke.&nbsp; The praise of his Elizabeth was a string which could
not be touched without causing every nerve of his whole frame to 
vibrate.</p>
<p>His voice half faltered as he spoke in reply; the tear stood 
in his eyes; his hand trembled as I pressed it; his heart was 
full; he could only say, &ldquo;Sir, a poor old man thanks you 
for your kindness to him and his family.&nbsp; God bless you, 
sir; I hope we shall soon see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we parted for that day.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>It has not unfrequently been observed, that when it is the 
Lord&rsquo;s pleasure to remove any of his faithful followers out
of this life at an early period of their course, they make rapid 
progress in the experience of Divine truth.&nbsp; The fruits of 
the Spirit ripen fast, as they advance to the close of mortal 
existence.&nbsp; In particular, they grow in humility, through a 
deeper sense of inward corruption, and a clearer view of the 
perfect character of the Saviour.&nbsp; Disease and bodily 
weakness make the thoughts of eternity recur with frequency and 
power.&nbsp; The great question of their own personal salvation, 
the quality of their faith, the sincerity of their love, and the 
purity of their hope, are in continual exercise.</p>
<p>Unseen realities, at such a time, occupy a larger portion of 
thought than before.&nbsp; The state of existence beyond the 
grave, the invisible world, the unaltered character of the dead, 
the future judgment, the total separation from everything 
earthly, the dissolution of body and spirit, and their reunion at
the solemn hour of resurrection&mdash;these are subjects for 
their meditation, which call for serious earnestness of 
soul.&nbsp; Whatever <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>consolations from the Spirit of God 
they may have enjoyed heretofore, they become now doubly anxious 
to examine and prove themselves, &ldquo;whether they be indeed in
the faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; In doing this, they sometimes pass 
through hidden conflicts of a dark and distressing nature; from 
which, however, they come forth, like gold tried in the 
furnace.&nbsp; Awhile they may sow in tears, but soon they reap 
in joy.</p>
<p>Their religious feelings have then, perhaps, less of ecstasy, 
but more of serenity.</p>
<p>As the ears of corn ripen for the harvest, they bow their 
heads nearer to the ground.&nbsp; So it is with believers; they 
then see more than ever of their own imperfection, and often 
express their sense of it in strong language; yet they repose 
with a growing confidence on the love of God through Christ 
Jesus.&nbsp; The nearer they advance to their eternal rest, the 
more humble they become, but not the less useful in their 
sphere.&nbsp; They feel anxiously desirous of improving every 
talent they possess to the glory of God, knowing that the time is
short.</p>
<p>I thought I observed the truth of these remarks fulfilled in 
the progressive state of mind of the Dairyman&rsquo;s 
daughter.</p>
<p>Declining health seemed to indicate the will of God concerning
her.&nbsp; But her character, conduct, <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>and 
experience of the Divine favour increased in brightness as the 
setting sun of her mortal life approached its horizon.&nbsp; The 
last letter which, with the exception of a very short note, I 
ever received from her, I shall now transcribe.&nbsp; It appeared
to me to bear the marks of a still deeper acquaintance with the 
workings of her own heart, and a more entire reliance upon the 
free mercy of God.</p>
<p>The original, while I copy it, strongly revives the image of 
the deceased, and the many profitable conversations which I once 
enjoyed in her company and that of her parents.&nbsp; It again 
endears to me the recollections of cottage piety; and helps me to
anticipate the joys of that day when the spirits of the glorified
saints shall be reunited to their bodies, and be for ever with 
the Lord.</p>
<p>The writer of this and the preceding letters herself little 
imagined, when they were penned, that they would ever be 
submitted to the public eye.&nbsp; That they now are so, results 
from a conviction that the friends of the pious poor will 
estimate them according to their value, and a hope that it may 
please God to honour these memorials of the dead, to the 
effectual edification of the living.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>&ldquo;Rev. Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;In consequence of your kind permission, I take the 
liberty to trouble you with another of my ill-written letters; 
and I trust you have too much of your blessed Maker&rsquo;s 
lowly, meek, and humble mind to be offended with a poor, simple, 
ignorant creature, whose intentions are pure and sincere in 
writing.&nbsp; My desire is that I, a weak vessel of his grace, 
may glorify his name for his goodness towards me.&nbsp; May the 
Lord direct me by his counsel and wisdom!&nbsp; May He overshadow
me with his presence, that I may sit beneath the banner of his 
love, and find the consolations of his blessed Spirit sweet and 
refreshing to my soul!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I feel that I am nothing, and God is all in all, 
then I can willingly fly to Him, saying, &lsquo;Lord, help me; 
Lord, teach me; be unto me my Prophet, Priest, and King; let me 
know the teaching of thy grace, and the disclosing of thy 
love.&rsquo;&nbsp; What nearness of access might we have if we 
lived more near to God!&nbsp; What sweet communion might we have 
with a God of love!&nbsp; He is the great I AM.&nbsp; How 
glorious a name!&nbsp; Angels with trembling awe prostrate 
themselves before Him, and in humble love adore and worship 
Him.&nbsp; One says,</p>
<p>&lsquo;While the first archangel sings,<br />
He hides his face behind his wings.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>Unworthy as I am, I have found it by experience, that 
the more I see of the greatness and goodness of God, and the 
nearer union I hope I have had with Him through the Spirit of his
love, the more humble and self-abased I have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But every day I may say, &lsquo;Lord, how little I love
thee, how far I live from thee, how little am I like thee in 
humility!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is nevertheless my heart&rsquo;s desire
to love and serve Him better.&nbsp; I find the way in which God 
does more particularly bless me, is when I attend on the public 
ordinances of religion.&nbsp; These are the channels through 
which He conveys the riches of his grace and precious love to my 
soul.&nbsp; These I have often found to be indeed the time of 
refreshing and strengthening from the presence of the Lord.&nbsp;
Then I can see my hope of an interest in the covenant of love, 
and praise Him for his mercy to the greatest of sinners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I earnestly wish to be more established in the ways, 
and to honour him in the path of duties whilst I enjoy the smiles
of his favour.&nbsp; In the midst of all outward afflictions I 
pray that I may know Christ, and the power of his resurrection 
within my soul.&nbsp; If I were always thus, my summer would last
all the year, my will would then be sweetly lost in God&rsquo;s 
will, and I should feel a resignation to every dispensation of 
his <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>providence and his grace, saying, &lsquo;Good is the 
will of the Lord: infinite wisdom cannot err.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then 
would patience have its perfect work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, alas! sin and unbelief often, too often, interrupt
these frames, and lay me low before God in tears of sorrow.&nbsp;
I often think what a happiness it would be, if his love were so 
fixed in my heart, that I might willingly obey Him with alacrity 
and delight, and gradually mortify the power of self-will, 
passion, and pride.&nbsp; This can only arise from a good hope, 
through grace, that we are washed in that precious blood which 
cleanses us from every sinful stain, and makes us new creatures 
in Christ.&nbsp; O that we may be the happy witnesses of the 
saving power and virtue of that healing stream which flows from 
the fountain of everlasting love!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, my faith is often exceedingly weak.&nbsp; Can you 
be so kind as to tell me what you have found to be the most 
effectual means of strengthening it?&nbsp; I often think how 
plainly the Lord declares&mdash;Believe only, and thou shalt be 
saved.&nbsp; Only have faith; all things are possible to him that
has it.&nbsp; How I wish that we could remove all those mountains
that hinder and obstruct the light of his grace; so that, having 
full access unto God through that ever-blessed Spirit, we might 
lovingly commune with Him as with the <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>dearest of 
friends.&nbsp; What favour doth God bestow on worms!&nbsp; And 
yet we love to murmur and complain.&nbsp; He may well say, What 
should I have done more that I have not done? or wherein have I 
proved unfaithful or unkind to my faithless backsliding 
children?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I pray that I may not grieve Him, as I have done, 
any more.&nbsp; I want your counsel and your prayers for me in 
this matter.&nbsp; How refreshing is the sight of one that truly 
loves God, that bears his image and likeness!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But delightful as is conversation with true believers 
on earth, whose hearts are lifted up to things above, yet what is
this to that happy day which will admit us into more bright 
realms, where we shall for ever behold a God of love in the 
smiling face of his Son, who is the express image of his Father, 
and the brightness of his glory!&nbsp; Then, if found in Him, we 
shall be received by the innumerable host of angels who wait 
around his throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, sir, may I take up my cross, and 
manfully fight under Him who, for the glory that was set before 
Him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down 
at his Father&rsquo;s right hand in majesty!&nbsp; I thank you 
for the kind liberty you have given to me of writing to 
you.&nbsp; I feel my health declining, and I <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>find a relief
during an hour of pain and weakness in communicating these 
thoughts to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, you go on your way rejoicing; that you are
enabled to thank Him who is the giver of every good gift, 
spiritual, temporal, and providential, for blessings to yourself 
and your ministry.&nbsp; I do not doubt but you often meet with 
circumstances which are not pleasing to nature; yet, by the 
blessing of God, they will be all profitable in the end.&nbsp; 
They are kindly designed by grace to make and keep us 
humble.&nbsp; The difficulties which you spoke of to me some time
since, will, I trust, disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear father and mother are as well as usual in 
bodily health; and, I hope, grow in grace, and in the knowledge 
and love of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; My chief desire to live is for 
their sakes.&nbsp; It now seems long since we have seen 
you.&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to request you to come to our 
little cottage, to visit those who are so far beneath your 
station in life.&nbsp; But if you cannot come, we shall be very 
glad if you will write a few lines.&nbsp; I ought to make an 
excuse for my letter, I spell so badly: this was a great neglect 
when I was young.&nbsp; I gave myself greatly to reading, but not
to the other; and now I am too weak and feeble to learn much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear sometimes of persons growing serious <!-- page 
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>in 
your congregation.&nbsp; It gives me joy; and, if true, I am sure
it does so to yourself.&nbsp; I long for the pure Gospel of 
Christ to be preached in every church in the world, and for the 
time when all shall know, love, and fear the Lord, and the 
uniting Spirit of God shall make them of one heart and mind in 
Christ our great Head.&nbsp; Your greatest joy, I know, will be 
in labouring much for the glory of God in the salvation of 
men&rsquo;s souls.&nbsp; You serve a good Master.&nbsp; You have 
a sure reward.&nbsp; I pray God to give you strength according to
your day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, do not be offended at the freedom and manner
of my writing.&nbsp; My parents&rsquo; duty and love to you are 
sent with these lines from</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your humble servant in Christ,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Epistolary communications, when written in sincerity of heart,
afford genuine portraits of the mind.&nbsp; May the foregoing be 
viewed with Christian candour, and consecrated to affectionate 
memory!</p>
<h2><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>Travellers, as they pass through the country, usually stop to 
inquire whose are the splendid mansions which they discover among
the woods and plains around them.&nbsp; The families, titles, 
fortune, or character of the respective owners engage much 
attention.&nbsp; Perhaps their houses are exhibited to the 
admiring stranger.&nbsp; The elegant rooms, costly furniture, 
valuable paintings, beautiful gardens and shrubberies, are 
universally approved; while the rank, fashion, taste, and riches 
of the possessor, afford ample materials for entertaining 
discussion.&nbsp; In the meantime, the lowly cottage of the poor 
husbandman is passed by as scarcely deserving of notice.&nbsp; 
Yet perchance such a cottage may often contain a treasure of 
infinitely more value than the sumptuous palace of the rich man; 
even &ldquo;the pearl of great price.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this be set
in the heart of the poor cottager, it proves a gem of unspeakable
worth, and will shine among the brightest ornaments of the 
Redeemer&rsquo;s crown, in that day when He maketh up his 
&ldquo;jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence the Christian traveller, while in common with others he 
bestows his due share of applause <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>on the 
decorations of the rich, and is not insensible to the beauties 
and magnificence which are the lawfully-allowed appendages of 
rank and fortune, cannot overlook the humbler dwelling of the 
poor.&nbsp; And if he should find that true piety and grace 
beneath the thatched roof which he has in vain looked for amidst 
the worldly grandeur of the rich, he remembers the declarations 
in the Word of God.&nbsp; He sees with admiration, that the high 
and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, who 
dwelleth in the high and holy place, dwelleth with <i>him 
also</i> that is of a contrite and humble spirit; and although 
heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, yet, when a 
house is to be built, and a place of rest to be sought for 
himself, He says, To this man will I look, even to him that is 
poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.&nbsp; 
(<i>See</i> Isa. lvii. 15; lxvi. 1, 2.)</p>
<p>When a house is thus tenanted, faith beholds this inscription 
written on the walls, <i>The Lord lives here</i>.&nbsp; Faith, 
therefore, cannot pass by it unnoticed, but loves to lift up the 
latch of the door, and to sit down and converse with the poor, 
although perhaps despised, inhabitant.&nbsp; Many a sweet 
interview does Faith obtain, when she thus takes her walks 
abroad.&nbsp; Many such a sweet interview have I myself enjoyed 
beneath <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>the roof where dwelt the Dairyman and
his little family.</p>
<p>I soon perceived that his daughter&rsquo;s health was rapidly 
on the decline.&nbsp; The pale, wasting consumption, which is the
Lord&rsquo;s instrument for removing so many thousands every year
from the land of the living, made hasty strides on her 
constitution.&nbsp; The hollow eye, the distressing cough, and 
the often too-flattering red on the cheek, foretold the approach 
of death.</p>
<p>What a field for usefulness and affectionate attention on the 
part of ministers and Christian friends is opened by the frequent
attacks, and lingering progress, of <i>consumptive</i> 
illness!&nbsp; How many such precious opportunities are daily 
lost, where Providence seems in so marked a way to afford time 
and space for serious and godly instruction!&nbsp; Of how many 
may it be said, &ldquo;The way of peace have they not 
known;&rdquo; for not one friend ever came nigh to warn them to 
&ldquo;flee from the wrath to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter was happily made acquainted 
with the things which belonged to her everlasting peace before 
the present disease had taken root in her constitution.&nbsp; In 
my visits to her, I went rather to receive information than to 
impart it.&nbsp; Her mind was abundantly stored with Divine 
truths, and her conversation <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>was truly 
edifying.&nbsp; The recollection of it must ever produce a 
thankful sensation in my heart.</p>
<p>I one day received a short note to the following 
effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very glad, if your convenience will allow, 
that you would come and see a poor unworthy sinner.&nbsp; My 
hour-glass is nearly run out; but I hope I can see Christ to be 
precious to my soul.&nbsp; Your conversation has often been 
blessed to me, and I now feel the need of it more than 
ever.&nbsp; My father and my mother send their duty to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your obedient</p>
<p>&ldquo;And unworthy servant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I obeyed the summons that same afternoon.&nbsp; On my arrival 
at the Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage his wife opened the door.&nbsp; 
The tears streamed down her cheek as she silently shook her 
head.&nbsp; Her heart was full.&nbsp; She tried to speak, but 
could not.&nbsp; I took her by the hand, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend, all is right, and as the Lord of wisdom
and mercy directs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my Betsy, my dear girl, is so bad, sir.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>What shall I do without her?&nbsp; I thought I should 
have gone first to the grave, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Lord sees good that, before you die yourself, 
you should behold your child safe home to glory.&nbsp; Is there 
no mercy in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, dear sir!&nbsp; I am very old and very weak, and she
is a dear child, the staff and prop of such a poor old creature 
as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I advanced, I saw Elizabeth sitting by the fireside, 
supported in an arm-chair by pillows, with every mark of rapid 
decline and approaching death.&nbsp; A sweet smile of friendly 
complacency enlightened her pale countenance as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very kind indeed, sir, to come so soon after I 
sent to you.&nbsp; You find me daily wasting away, and I cannot 
have long to continue here.&nbsp; My flesh and my heart fail; but
God is the strength of my weak heart, and, I trust, will be my 
portion for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was occasionally interrupted by her cough and
want of breath.&nbsp; Her tone of voice was clear, though feeble;
her manner solemn and collected; and her eye, though more dim 
than formerly, by no means wanting in liveliness as she 
spoke.&nbsp; I had frequently admired the superior language in 
which she expressed her ideas, as well as the scriptural <!-- 
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>consistency with which she communicated her 
thoughts.&nbsp; She had a good natural understanding; and grace, 
as is generally the case, much improved it.&nbsp; On the present 
occasion I could not help thinking she was peculiarly 
favoured.&nbsp; The whole strength of gracious and natural 
attainments seemed to be in full exercise.</p>
<p>After taking my seat between the daughter and the mother (the 
latter fixing her fond eyes upon her child with great anxiety, 
while we were conversing), I said to Elizabeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you enjoy a sense of the Divine presence, and 
can rest all upon Him who has &lsquo;been with thee,&rsquo; and 
has kept &lsquo;thee in all places whither thou hast gone,&rsquo;
and will bring thee into &lsquo;the land of pure delights, where 
saints immortal reign.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I think I can.&nbsp; My mind has lately been 
sometimes clouded, but I believe it has been partly owing to the 
great weakness and suffering of my bodily frame, and partly to 
the envy of my spiritual enemy, who wants to persuade me that 
Christ has no love for me, and that I have been a 
self-deceiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you give way to his suggestions?&nbsp; Can you 
doubt amidst such numerous tokens of past and present 
mercy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I mostly am enabled to preserve a <!-- page 
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>clear
evidence of his love.&nbsp; I do not wish to add to my other sins
that of denying his manifest goodness to my soul.&nbsp; I would 
acknowledge it to his praise and glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your present view of the state in which you 
were before you felt seriously concerned about the salvation of 
your soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I was a proud, thoughtless girl, fond of dress and
finery; I loved the world, and the things that are in the world; 
I lived in service among worldly people, and never had the 
happiness of being in a family where worship was regarded, and 
the souls of the servants cared for either by master or 
mistress.&nbsp; I went once on a Sunday to church, more to see 
and be seen than to pray or hear the word of God.&nbsp; I thought
I was quite good enough to be saved, and disliked and often 
laughed at religious people.&nbsp; I was in great darkness; I 
knew nothing of the way of salvation; I never prayed, nor was 
sensible of the awful danger of a prayerless state.&nbsp; I 
wished to maintain the character of a good servant, and was much 
lifted up whenever I met with applause.&nbsp; I was tolerably 
moral and decent in my conduct, from motives of carnal and 
worldly policy; but I was a stranger to God and Christ; I 
neglected my soul; and had I died in such a state, hell must, and
would justly, have been my portion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
86</span>&ldquo;How long is it since you heard the sermon which 
you hope, through God&rsquo;s blessing, effected your 
conversion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it brought about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was reported that a Mr ---, who was detained by 
contrary winds from embarking on board ship, as chaplain to a 
distant part of the world, was to preach at church.&nbsp; Many 
advised me not to go, for fear he should turn my head; as they 
said he held strange notions.&nbsp; But curiosity and an 
opportunity of appearing in a new gown, which I was very proud 
of, induced me to ask leave of my mistress to go.&nbsp; Indeed, 
sir, I had no better motives than vanity and curiosity.&nbsp; Yet
thus it pleased the Lord to order it for his own glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accordingly went to church, and saw a great crowd of 
people collected together.&nbsp; I often think of the contrary 
states of my mind during the former and latter part of the 
service.&nbsp; For a while, regardless of the worship of God, I 
looked around me, and was anxious to attract notice myself.&nbsp;
My dress, like that of too many gay, vain, and silly servant 
girls, was much above my station, and very different from that 
which becomes an humble sinner, who has a modest sense of 
propriety and decency.&nbsp; The state of <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>my mind was 
visible enough from the foolish finery of my apparel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length the clergyman gave out his text: &lsquo;Be 
<i>ye</i> clothed with humility&rsquo; (1 Pet. v. 5).&nbsp; He 
drew a comparison between the clothing of the body with that of 
the soul.&nbsp; At a very early part of his discourse, I began to
feel ashamed of my passion for fine dressing and apparel; but 
when he came to describe the garment of salvation with which a 
Christian is clothed, I felt a powerful discovery of the 
nakedness of my own soul.&nbsp; I saw that I had neither the 
humility mentioned in the text, nor any one part of the true 
Christian character.&nbsp; I looked at my gay dress, and blushed 
for shame on account of my pride.&nbsp; I looked at the minister,
and he seemed to be as a messenger sent from heaven to open my 
eyes.&nbsp; I looked on the congregation, and wondered whether 
any one else felt as I did.&nbsp; I looked at my heart, and it 
appeared full of iniquity.&nbsp; I trembled as he spoke, and yet 
I felt a great drawing of heart to the words he uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He displayed the riches of Divine grace in God&rsquo;s 
method of saving the sinner.&nbsp; I was astonished at what I had
been doing all the days of my life.&nbsp; He described the meek, 
lowly, and humble example of Christ; I felt proud, lofty, vain, 
and self-consequential.&nbsp; He represented <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Christ as 
&lsquo;Wisdom;&rsquo; I felt my ignorance.&nbsp; He held Him 
forth as &lsquo;Righteousness;&rsquo; I was convinced of my own 
guilt.&nbsp; He proved Him to be &lsquo;Sanctification;&rsquo; I 
saw my corruption.&nbsp; He proclaimed Him as 
&lsquo;Redemption;&rsquo; I felt my slavery to sin, and my 
captivity to Satan.&nbsp; He concluded with an animated address 
to sinners, in which he exhorted them to flee from the wrath to 
come, to cast off the love of outward ornaments, to put on Jesus 
Christ, and be clothed with true humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that hour I never lost sight of the value of my 
soul, and the danger of a sinful state.&nbsp; I inwardly blessed 
God for the sermon, although my mind was in a state of great 
confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preacher had brought forward the ruling passion of 
my heart, which was pride in outward dress; and by the grace of 
God it was made instrumental to the awakening of my soul.&nbsp; 
Happy, sir, would it be, if many a poor girl, like myself, were 
turned from the love of outward adorning and putting on of fine 
apparel, to seek that which is not corruptible, even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greater part of the congregation, unused to such 
faithful and scriptural sermons, disliked <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and 
complained of the severity of the preacher: while a few, as I 
afterwards found, like myself, were deeply affected, and 
earnestly wished to hear him again.&nbsp; But he preached there 
no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that time I was led, through a course of private 
prayer, reading, and meditation, to see my lost estate as a 
sinner, and the great mercy of God through Jesus Christ in 
raising sinful dust and ashes to a share in the glorious 
happiness of heaven.&nbsp; And O, sir, what a Saviour I have 
found!&nbsp; He is more than I could ask or desire.&nbsp; In his 
fulness I have found all that my poverty could need; in his bosom
I have found a resting-place from all sin and sorrow; in his Word
I have found strength against doubt and unbelief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you not soon convinced,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
your salvation must be an act of entire grace on the part of God,
wholly independent of your own previous works or 
deservings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir, what were my works before I heard that 
sermon, but evil, carnal, selfish, and ungodly?&nbsp; The 
thoughts of my heart, from my youth upward, were only evil, and 
that continually.&nbsp; And my deservings, what were they but the
deservings of a fallen, depraved, careless soul, that regarded 
neither law nor gospel?&nbsp; Yes, <!-- page 90--><a 
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>sir, I 
immediately saw that, if ever I were saved, it must be by the 
free mercy of God, and that the whole praise and honour of the 
work would be his from first to last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What change did you perceive in yourself with respect 
to the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appeared all vanity and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; I 
found it necessary to my peace of mind to come out from among 
them and be separate.&nbsp; I gave myself to prayer; and many a 
happy hour of secret delight I enjoyed in communion with 
God.&nbsp; Often I mourned over my sins, and sometimes had a 
great conflict through unbelief, fear, temptation, to return back
again to my old ways, and a variety of difficulties which lay in 
my way.&nbsp; But He who loved me with an everlasting love, drew 
me by his loving-kindness, showed me the way of peace, gradually 
strengthened me in my resolutions of leading a new life, and 
taught me, that while without him I could do nothing, I yet might
do all things through his strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not find many difficulties in your situation, 
owing to your change of principle and practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, every day of my life.&nbsp; I was laughed at 
by some, scolded at by others, scorned by enemies, and pitied by 
friends.&nbsp; I was called hypocrite, saint, false deceiver, and
many more <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>names which were meant to render me 
hateful in the sight of the world.&nbsp; But I esteemed the 
reproach of the Cross an honour.&nbsp; I forgave and prayed for 
my persecutors, and remembered how very lately I had acted the 
same part towards others myself.&nbsp; I thought also that Christ
endured the contradiction of sinners; and as the disciple is not 
above his Master, I was glad to be in any way conformed to his 
sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not then feel for your family at 
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I did indeed, sir; they were never out of my 
thoughts.&nbsp; I prayed continually for them, and had a longing 
desire to do them good.&nbsp; In particular, I felt for my father
and mother, as they were getting into years, and were very 
ignorant and dark in matters of religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; interrupted her mother, sobbing, 
&ldquo;ignorant and dark, sinful and miserable we were, till this
dear Betsy&mdash;this dear Betsy&mdash;this dear child, 
sir&mdash;brought Christ Jesus home to her poor father and 
mother&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearest mother; say rather, Christ Jesus brought 
your poor daughter home, to tell you what He had done for her 
soul, and, I hope, to do the same for yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the Dairyman came in with two pails of milk 
hanging from the yoke on his <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>shoulders.&nbsp; He had stood behind the half-opened 
door for a few minutes, and heard the last sentences spoken by 
his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessing and mercy upon her!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it 
is very true: she left a good place of service on purpose to live
with us, that she might help us both in soul and body.&nbsp; Sir,
don&rsquo;t she look very ill?&nbsp; I think, sir, we 
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have her here long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to the Lord,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;All our times are in his hand, and happy it is that they 
are.&nbsp; I am willing to go.&nbsp; Are not you willing, my 
father, to part with me into <i>his</i> hands who gave me to you 
at first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me any question in the world but that,&rdquo; said 
the weeping father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you wish me to be 
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;let the Lord do 
with you and us as best pleases Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then asked her on what her present consolations chiefly 
depended, in the prospect of approaching death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely, sir, on my view of Christ.&nbsp; When I look 
at myself, many sins, infirmities, and imperfections cloud the 
image of Christ which I want to see in my own heart.&nbsp; But 
when I look at the Saviour himself, He is altogether lovely; <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>there is not one spot in his countenance, nor one cloud 
over all his perfections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think of his coming in the flesh, and it reconciles 
me to the sufferings of the body; for He had them as well as 
I.&nbsp; I think of his temptations, and believe that He is able 
to succour me when I am tempted.&nbsp; Then I think of his cross,
and learn to bear my own.&nbsp; I reflect on his death, and long 
to die unto sin, so that it may no longer have dominion over 
me.&nbsp; I sometimes think of his resurrection, and trust that 
He has given me a part in it, for I feel that my affections are 
set upon things above.&nbsp; Chiefly, I take comfort in thinking 
of Him as at the right hand of the Father, pleading my cause, and
rendering acceptable even my feeble prayers, both for myself, 
and, as I hope, for my dear friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the views which, through mercy, I have of my 
Saviour&rsquo;s goodness; and they have made me wish and strive 
in my poor way to serve Him, to give myself up to Him, and to 
labour to do my duty in that state of life into which it has 
pleased Him to call me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand times I should have fallen and fainted, if 
He had not upheld me.&nbsp; I feel that I am nothing without 
Him.&nbsp; He is all in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so far as I can cast my care upon Him <!-- page 
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>I 
find strength to do his will.&nbsp; May He give me grace to trust
Him till the last moment!&nbsp; I do not fear death, because I 
believe that He has taken away its sting.&nbsp; And O, what 
happiness beyond!&nbsp; Tell me, sir, whether you think I am 
right&mdash;I hope I am under no delusion.&nbsp; I dare not look 
for my hope in anything short of the entire fulness of 
Christ.&nbsp; When I ask my own heart a question, I am afraid to 
trust it, for it is treacherous, and has often deceived me.&nbsp;
But when I ask Christ, he answers me with promises that 
strengthen and refresh me, and leave me no room to doubt his 
power and will to save.&nbsp; I am in his hands, and would remain
there; and I do believe that He will never leave nor forsake me, 
but will perfect the thing that concerns me.&nbsp; He loved me, 
and gave himself for me; and I believe that his gifts and calling
are without repentance.&nbsp; In this hope I live, in this hope I
wish to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked around me, as she was speaking, and 
thought&mdash;Surely this is none other than the house of God, 
and the gate of heaven.&nbsp; Everything appeared neat, cleanly, 
and interesting.&nbsp; The afternoon had been rather overcast 
with dark clouds; but just now the setting sun shone brightly and
somewhat suddenly into the room.&nbsp; It was reflected from 
three or four rows of bright <!-- page 95--><a 
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>pewter plates
and white earthenware, arranged on shelves against the wall; it 
also gave brilliancy to a few prints of sacred subjects that hung
there also, and served for monitors of the birth, baptism, 
crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>A large map of Jerusalem, and a hieroglyphic of &ldquo;the old
and new man,&rdquo; completed the decorations on that side of the
room.&nbsp; Clean as was the whitewashed wall, it was not cleaner
than the rest of the place and its furniture.&nbsp; Seldom had 
the sun enlightened a house where order and general neatness 
(those sure attendants of pious poverty) were more 
conspicuous.</p>
<p>This gleam of setting sunshine was emblematical of the bright 
and serene close of this young Christian&rsquo;s departing 
season.&nbsp; One ray happened to be reflected from a little 
looking-glass upon her face.&nbsp; Amidst her pallid and decaying
features there appeared a calm resignation, triumphant 
confidence, unaffected humility, and tender anxiety, which fully 
declared the feelings of her heart.</p>
<p>Some further affectionate conversation and a short prayer 
closed this interview.</p>
<p>As I rode home by departing day-light, a solemn tranquillity 
reigned throughout the scene.&nbsp; The gentle lowing of cattle, 
the bleating of sheep <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>just penned in their folds, the 
humming of the insects of the night, the distant murmurs of the 
sea, the last notes of the birds of day, and the first warblings 
of the nightingale, broke upon the ear, and served rather to 
increase than lessen the peaceful serenity of the evening, and 
its corresponding effects on my own mind.&nbsp; It invited and 
cherished just such meditations as my visit had already 
inspired.&nbsp; Natural scenery, when viewed in a Christian 
mirror, frequently affords very beautiful illustrations of Divine
truths.&nbsp; We are highly favoured when we can enjoy them, and 
at the same time draw near to God in them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>It is a pleasing consideration that, amidst the spiritual 
darkness which unhappily prevails in many parts of the land, God 
nevertheless has a people.&nbsp; It not unfrequently happens, 
that single individuals are to be found who, though very 
disadvantageously situated with regard to the ordinary means of 
grace, have received truly saving impressions, <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and through a
blessing on secret meditation, reading, and prayer, are led to 
the closest communion with God, and become eminently devoted 
Christians.&nbsp; It is the no small error of too many professors
of the present day, to overlook or undervalue the instances of 
this kind which exist.&nbsp; The religious profession and 
opinions of some have too much of mere <i>machinery</i> in their 
composition.&nbsp; If every wheel, pivot, chain, spring, cog, or 
pinion, be not exactly in its place, or move not precisely 
according to a favourite and prescribed system, the whole is 
rejected as unworthy of regard.&nbsp; But happily &ldquo;the Lord
knoweth them that are his;&rdquo; nor is the impression of his 
own seal wanting to characterise some who, in comparative 
seclusion from the religious world, &ldquo;name the name of 
Christ, and depart from iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some real Christians so particularly circumstanced 
in this respect, as to illustrate the poet&rsquo;s beautiful 
comparison:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark unfathom&rsquo;d caves of ocean bear;<br />
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And waste its sweetness on the desert 
air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet this was not altogether the case with the Dairyman&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; Her religion had indeed ripened in seclusion from
the world, and she was <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>intimately known but to few; but she 
lived usefully, departed most happily, and left a shining track 
behind her.&nbsp; While I attempt a faint delineation of it, may 
I catch its influence, and become, through inexpressible mercy, a
follower &ldquo;of them, who through faith and patience inherit 
the promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the time wherein I visited her, as described in my last 
paper, I considered her end as fast approaching.&nbsp; One day I 
received a hasty summons to inform me that she was dying.&nbsp; 
It was brought by a soldier, whose countenance bespoke 
seriousness, good sense, and piety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sent, sir, by the father and mother of Elizabeth 
W---, at her own particular request, to say how much they all 
wish to see you.&nbsp; She is going <i>home</i>, sir, very fast 
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you known her long?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month, sir.&nbsp; I love to visit the sick; and
hearing of her case from a person who lives close by our camp, I 
went to see her.&nbsp; I bless God that ever I did go.&nbsp; Her 
conversation has been very profitable to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rejoice,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to see in you, as I 
trust, a <i>brother soldier</i>.&nbsp; Though we differ in our 
outward regimentals, I hope we serve under the same spiritual 
Captain.&nbsp; I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My horse was soon ready.&nbsp; My military companion <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>walked by my side, and gratified me with very sensible 
and pious conversation.&nbsp; He related some remarkable 
testimonies of the excellent disposition of the Dairyman&rsquo;s 
daughter, as they appeared from recent intercourse which he had 
had with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a bright diamond, sir,&rdquo; said the soldier, 
&ldquo;and will soon shine brighter than any diamond upon 
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed through lanes and fields, over hills and through 
valleys, by open and retired paths, sometimes crossing over, and 
sometimes following the windings of a little brook, which gently 
murmured by the road-side.&nbsp; Conversation beguiled the 
distance, and shortened the apparent time of our journey, till we
were nearly arrived at the Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>As we approached it, we became silent.&nbsp; Thoughts of 
death, eternity, and salvation, inspired by the sight of a house 
where a dying believer lay, filled my own mind, and, I doubt not,
that of my companion also.</p>
<p>No living object yet appeared, except the Dairyman&rsquo;s 
dog, keeping a kind of mute watch at the door; for he did not, as
formerly, bark at my approach.&nbsp; He seemed to partake so far 
of the feelings appropriate to the circumstances of the family, 
as not to wish to give a hasty or <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>painful 
alarm.&nbsp; He came forward to the little wicket-gate, then 
looked back at the house-door, as if conscious there was sorrow 
within.&nbsp; It was as if he wanted to say, &ldquo;Tread softly 
over the threshold, as you enter the house of mourning; for my 
master&rsquo;s heart is full of grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier took my horse, and tied it up in a shed.&nbsp; A 
solemn serenity appeared to surround the whole place; it was only
interrupted by the breezes passing through the large elm-trees, 
which stood near the house, and which my imagination indulged 
itself in thinking were plaintive sighs of sorrow.&nbsp; I gently
opened the door; no one appeared; and all was yet silent.&nbsp; 
The soldier followed; we came to the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are come,&rdquo; said a voice, which I knew to be 
the father&rsquo;s &ldquo;they are come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared at the top.&nbsp; I gave him my hand, and said 
nothing.&nbsp; On entering the room above, I saw the aged mother 
and her son supporting the much-loved sister: the son&rsquo;s 
wife sat weeping in a window-seat, with a child on her lap; two 
or three persons attended in the room to discharge any office 
which friendship or necessity might require.</p>
<p>I sat down by the bed-side.&nbsp; The mother could not weep, 
but now and then sighed <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>deeply, as 
she alternately looked at Elizabeth and at me.&nbsp; The big tear
rolled down the brother&rsquo;s cheek, and testified an 
affectionate regard.&nbsp; The good old man stood at the foot of 
the bed, leaning upon the post, and unable to take his eyes off 
the child from whom he was so soon to part.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and as yet she perceived 
me not.&nbsp; But over the face, though pale, sunk, and hollow, 
the peace of God which passeth all understanding, had cast a 
triumphant calm.</p>
<p>The soldier, after a short pause, silently reached out his 
Bible towards me, pointing with his finger at 1 Cor. xv. 55, 56, 
58.&nbsp; I then broke silence by reading the passage, &ldquo;O 
death, where is thy sting?&nbsp; O grave, where is thy 
victory?&nbsp; The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin
is the law.&nbsp; But thanks be to God which giveth us the 
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of these words her eyes opened, and something 
like a ray of Divine light beamed on her countenance, as she 
said, &ldquo;Victory, victory! through our Lord Jesus 
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed again, taking no further notice of any one 
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be praised for the triumph of faith!&rdquo; said 
I.</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; replied the soldier.</p>
<p>The Dairyman&rsquo;s uplifted eye showed that the amen was in 
his heart, though his tongue failed to utter it.&nbsp; A short 
struggling for breath took place in the dying young woman, which 
was soon over; and then I said to her,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, do you not feel that you are 
supported?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord deals very gently with me,&rdquo; she 
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are not his promises now very precious to 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all yea and amen in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in much bodily pain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So little, that I almost forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good the Lord is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how unworthy am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to see Him as He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;I believe that I 
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She again fell into a short slumber.</p>
<p>Looking at her mother, I said, &ldquo;What a mercy to have a 
child so near heaven as yours is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a mercy,&rdquo; she replied, in broken 
accents, &ldquo;if her poor old mother might but follow her 
there!&nbsp; But, sir, it is so hard to part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope through grace by faith you will soon meet, to 
part no more: it will be but a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Dairyman, &ldquo;that 
thought supports me, and the Lord&rsquo;s goodness makes me feel 
more reconciled than I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, mother,&rdquo; said the reviving daughter, 
&ldquo;He is good to me&mdash;trust Him, praise Him 
evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; added she, in a faint voice, &ldquo;I want 
to thank you for your kindness to me&mdash;I want to ask a 
favour; you buried my sister&mdash;will you do the same for 
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All shall be as you wish, if God permit;&rdquo; I 
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you.&nbsp; I have another favour 
to ask: when I am gone, remember my father and mother.&nbsp; They
are old, but I hope the good work is begun in their souls.&nbsp; 
My prayers are heard.&nbsp; Pray come and see them.&nbsp; I 
cannot speak much, but I want to speak for their sakes.&nbsp; 
Sir, remember them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aged parents now sighed and sobbed aloud, uttering broken 
sentences, and gained some relief by such an expression of their 
feelings.</p>
<p>At length I said to Elizabeth&mdash;&ldquo;Do you experience 
any doubts or temptations on the subject of your eternal 
safety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; the Lord deals very gently with me, and gives 
me peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;What are your views of the dark valley of death,
now that you are passing through it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>not</i> dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord is <i>there</i>, and He is my light and my 
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any fears of more bodily suffering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord deals so gently with me, I can trust 
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of a convulsion came on.&nbsp; When it was past, she
said again and again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord deals very gently with me.&nbsp; Lord, I am 
thine, save me&mdash;blessed Jesus&mdash;precious 
Saviour&mdash;his blood cleanseth from all sin&mdash;Who shall 
separate?&mdash;His name is Wonderful&mdash;Thanks be to 
God&mdash;He giveth us the victory&mdash;I, even I, am 
saved&mdash;O grace, mercy, and wonder&mdash;Lord, receive my 
spirit!&nbsp; Dear sir, dear father, mother, friends, I am 
going&mdash;but all is well, well, well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed again.&nbsp; We knelt down to prayer: the Lord 
was in the midst of us, and blessed us.</p>
<p>She did not again revive while I remained, nor ever speak any 
more words which could be understood.&nbsp; She slumbered for 
about ten hours, and at last sweetly fell asleep in the arms of 
that Lord who had dealt so gently with her.</p>
<p>I left the house an hour after she had ceased <!-- page 
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>to
speak.&nbsp; I pressed her hand as I was taking leave, and said 
&ldquo;Christ is the Resurrection and the Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; She 
gently returned the pressure, but could neither open her eyes nor
utter a reply.</p>
<p>I never had witnessed a scene so impressive as this 
before.&nbsp; It completely filled my imagination as I returned 
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;dear friend, till 
the morning of an eternal day shall renew our personal 
intercourse.&nbsp; Thou wast a brand plucked from the burning, 
that thou mightest become a star shining in the firmament of 
glory.&nbsp; I have seen thy light and thy good works, and will 
therefore glorify our Father which is in heaven.&nbsp; I have 
seen, in thy example, what it is to be a sinner freely saved by 
grace.&nbsp; I have learned from thee, as in a living mirror, who
it is that begins, continues, and ends the work of faith and 
love.&nbsp; Jesus is all in all: He will and shall be 
glorified.&nbsp; He won the crown, and alone deserves to wear 
it.&nbsp; May no one attempt to rob Him of his glory!&nbsp; He 
saves, and saves to the uttermost.&nbsp; Farewell, dear sister in
the Lord!&nbsp; Thy flesh and thy heart may fail; but God is the 
strength of thy heart, and shall be thy portion for 
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>Who can conceive or estimate the nature of that change which 
the soul of a believer must experience at the moment when, 
quitting its tabernacle of clay, it suddenly enters into the 
presence of God?&nbsp; If, even while &ldquo;we see through a 
glass darkly,&rdquo; the views of Divine love and wisdom are so 
delightful to the eye of faith, what must be the glorious vision 
of God, when seen face to face?&nbsp; If it be so valued a 
privilege here on earth to enjoy the communion of saints, and to 
take sweet counsel together with our fellow-travellers towards 
the heavenly kingdom, what shall we see and know when we finally 
&ldquo;come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God,
the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, 
to the General Assembly and Church of the Firstborn, which are 
written in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the 
spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of 
the New Covenant?&rdquo; (Heb. xii. 22-24.)</p>
<p>If, during the sighs and tears of a mortal pilgrimage, the 
consolations of the Spirit are so precious, and the hope full of 
immortality is so animating to the soul, what heart can conceive,
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>or what tongue utter its superior joys, when arrived at
that state where sighing and sorrow flee away, and the tears 
shall be wiped from every eye?</p>
<p>Such ideas were powerfully associated together in my 
imagination as I travelled onward to the house where, in solemn 
preparation for the grave, lay the remains of the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>She had breathed her last shortly after the visit related in 
my former account.&nbsp; Permission was obtained, as before, in 
the case of her sister, that I should perform the funeral 
service.&nbsp; Many pleasing yet melancholy thoughts were 
connected with the fulfilment of this task.&nbsp; I retraced the 
numerous and important conversations which I had held with 
her.</p>
<p>But these could now no longer be maintained on earth.&nbsp; I 
reflected on the interesting and improved nature of 
<i>Christian</i> friendships, whether formed in palaces or in 
cottages; and felt thankful that I had so long enjoyed that 
privilege with the subject of this memoir.&nbsp; I then indulged 
a selfish sigh for a moment, on thinking that I could no longer 
hear the great truths of Christianity uttered by one who had 
drunk so deep of the waters of the river of life; but the rising 
murmur was checked by the animating thought: &ldquo;She is gone 
to eternal <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>rest&mdash;could I wish her back 
again in this vale of tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the first sound of a tolling bell struck my 
ear.&nbsp; It proceeded from a village church in the valley 
directly beneath the ridge of a high hill, over which I had taken
my way.&nbsp; It was Elizabeth&rsquo;s funeral knell.</p>
<p>The sound was solemn; and in ascending to the elevated spot 
over which I rode, it acquired a peculiar tone and 
character.&nbsp; Tolling at slow and regular intervals (as was 
customary for a considerable time previous to the hour of 
burial), the bell, as it were, proclaimed the blessedness of the 
dead who die in the Lord, and also the necessity of the living 
pondering these things, and laying them to heart.&nbsp; It seemed
to say: &ldquo;Hear my warning voice, thou son of man.&nbsp; 
There is but a step between thee and death.&nbsp; Arise, prepare 
thine house, for thou shall die and not live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scenery was in unison with that tranquil frame of mind 
which is most suitable for holy meditation.&nbsp; A rich and 
fruitful valley lay immediately beneath; it was adorned with 
cornfields and pastures through which a small river winded in a 
variety of directions, and many herds grazed upon its 
banks.&nbsp; A fine range of opposite hills, covered with grazing
flocks, terminated <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>with a bold sweep into the ocean, 
whose blue waves appeared at a distance beyond.&nbsp; Several 
villages, hamlets, and churches, were scattered in the 
valley.&nbsp; The noble mansions of the rich, and the lowly 
cottages of the poor, added their respective features to the 
landscape.</p>
<p>Do any of my readers inquire why I describe so minutely the 
circumstances of prospect and scenery which may be connected with
the incidents I relate?&nbsp; My reply is, that the God of 
redemption is the God of creation likewise; and that we are 
taught in every part of the Word of God to unite the admiration 
of the beauties and wonders of nature to every other motive for 
devotion.&nbsp; When David considered the heavens, the work of 
God&rsquo;s fingers, the moon and the stars which He has 
ordained, he was thereby led to the deepest humiliation of heart 
before his Maker.&nbsp; And when he viewed the sheep, and the 
oxen, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the 
fish of the sea, he was constrained to cry out, &ldquo;O Lord, 
our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&rdquo; (Ps.
viii. 1.)</p>
<p>I am the poor man&rsquo;s friend, and wish more especially 
that every poor labouring man should know how to connect the 
goodness of God in creation and providence, with the unsearchable
riches of his grace in the salvation of a sinner.&nbsp; <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>And where can he learn this lesson more instructively 
than in looking around the fields, where his labour is appointed,
and there tracing the handiwork of God in all that he 
beholds?&nbsp; Such meditations have often afforded me both 
profit and pleasure, and I wish my readers to share them with 
me.</p>
<p>The Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage was rather more than a mile 
distant from the church.&nbsp; A lane, quite overshadowed with 
trees and high hedges, led from the foot of the hill to his 
dwelling.&nbsp; It was impossible at that time to overlook the 
suitable gloom of such an approach to the house of mourning.</p>
<p>I found, on my entrance, that several Christian friends from 
different parts of the neighbourhood had assembled together, to 
pay their last tribute of esteem and regard to the memory of the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Several of them had first become
acquainted with her during the latter stage of her illness: some 
few had maintained an affectionate intercourse with her for a 
longer period.&nbsp; But all seemed anxious to manifest their 
respect for one who was endeared to them by such striking 
testimonies of true Christianity.</p>
<p>I was requested to go into the chamber where the relatives and
a few other friends were gone to take a last look at the remains 
of Elizabeth.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>It is not easy to describe the sensation which the mind
experiences on the first sight of a dead countenance, which, when
living, was loved and esteemed for the sake of that soul which 
used to give it animation.&nbsp; A deep and awful view of the 
separation that has taken place between the soul and body of the 
deceased, since we last beheld them, occupies the feelings; our 
friend seems to be both near, and yet far off.&nbsp; The most 
interesting and valuable part is fled away: what remains is but 
the earthly perishing habitation, no longer occupied by its 
tenant.&nbsp; Yet the features present the accustomed association
of friendly intercourse.&nbsp; For one moment we could think them
asleep.&nbsp; The next reminds us that the blood circulates no 
more: the eye has lost its power of seeing, the ear of hearing, 
the heart of throbbing, and the limbs of moving.&nbsp; Quickly a 
thought of glory breaks in upon the mind, and we imagine the dear
departed soul to be arrived at its long wished-for rest.&nbsp; It
is surrounded by cherubim and seraphim, and sings the song of 
Moses and the Lamb on Mount Sion.&nbsp; Amid the solemn stillness
of the chamber of death, imagination hears heavenly hymns chanted
by the spirits of just men made perfect.&nbsp; In another moment,
the livid lips and sunken eye of the clay-cold corpse recall our 
thoughts <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>to earth, and to ourselves 
again.&nbsp; And while we think of mortality, sin, death, and the
grave, we feel the prayer rise in our bosom&mdash;&ldquo;O let me
die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like 
his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there be a moment when Christ and salvation, death, 
judgment, heaven, and hell, appear more than ever to be momentous
subjects of meditation, it is that which brings us to the side of
a coffin containing the body of a departed believer.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s features were altered, but much of her 
likeness remained.&nbsp; Her father and mother sat at the head, 
her brother at the foot of the coffin.&nbsp; The father silently 
and alternately looked upon his dead child, and then lifted up 
his eyes to heaven.&nbsp; A struggle for resignation to the will 
of God was manifest in his countenance; while the tears rolling 
down his aged cheeks at the same time declared his grief and 
affection.&nbsp; The poor mother cried and sobbed aloud, and 
appeared to be much overcome by the shock of separation from a 
daughter so justly dear to her.&nbsp; The weakness and infirmity 
of old age added a character to her sorrow, which called for much
tenderness and compassion.</p>
<p>A remarkably decent-looking woman, who had the management of 
the few simple though <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>solemn ceremonies which the case 
required, advanced towards me, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, this is rather a sight of joy than of 
sorrow.&nbsp; Our dear friend Elizabeth finds it to be so, I have
no doubt.&nbsp; She is beyond <i>all</i> sorrow.&nbsp; Do you not
think she is, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what I have known, and seen, and heard,&rdquo; I 
replied, &ldquo;I feel the fullest assurance that while her body 
remains here, the soul is with her Saviour in Paradise.&nbsp; She
loved Him <i>here</i>, and <i>there</i> she enjoys the pleasures 
which are at his right hand for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, mercy upon a poor old creature, almost broken 
down with age and grief!&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; 
Betsy&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; My daughter&rsquo;s dead!&nbsp; O, my 
child!&nbsp; I shall never see thee more!&nbsp; God be merciful 
to me a sinner!&rdquo;&mdash;sobbed out the poor mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That last prayer, my dear, good woman,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;will bring you and your child together again.&nbsp; It is 
a cry that has brought thousands to glory.&nbsp; It brought your 
daughter there, and I hope it will bring you thither 
likewise.&nbsp; God will in nowise cast out any that come to 
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the Dairyman, breaking the long 
silence he had maintained, &ldquo;let us trust God with our 
child; and let us trust Him with <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>our 
ownselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken 
away; blessed be the name of the Lord!&rsquo;&nbsp; We are old, 
and can have but a little further to travel in our journey, and 
then&mdash;&rdquo; he could say no more.</p>
<p>The soldier, mentioned in my last paper, reached a Bible into 
my hand, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you would not object
to reading a chapter before we go to the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so; it was the fourteenth of the Book of Job.&nbsp; A 
sweet tranquillity prevailed while I read it.&nbsp; Each minute 
that was spent in this funereal chamber seemed to be 
valuable.&nbsp; I made a few observations on the chapter, and 
connected them with the case of our departed sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am but a poor soldier,&rdquo; said our military 
friend, &ldquo;and have nothing of this world&rsquo;s goods 
beyond my daily subsistence; but I would not exchange my hope of 
salvation in the next world for all that this world could bestow 
without it.&nbsp; What is wealth without grace?&nbsp; Blessed be 
God! as I march about from one quarter to another, I still find 
the Lord wherever I go; and, thanks be to his holy name, He is 
here to-day in the midst of this company of the living and the 
dead.&nbsp; I feel that it is good to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some other persons present began to take a <!-- page 115--><a 
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>part in our
conversation, in the course of which the life and experience of 
the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter were brought forward in a very 
interesting manner.&nbsp; Each friend had something to relate in 
testimony of her gracious disposition.&nbsp; A young woman under 
twenty, who had hitherto been a very light and trifling 
character, appeared to be remarkably impressed by the 
conversation of that day; and I have since had reason to believe 
that Divine grace then began to influence her in the choice of 
that better part, which shall not be taken from her.</p>
<p>What a contrast does such a scene as this exhibit, when 
compared with the dull, formal, unedifying, and often indecent 
manner in which funeral parties assemble in the house of 
death!</p>
<p>As we conversed, the parents revived.&nbsp; Our subject of 
discourse was delightful to their hearts.&nbsp; Their child 
seemed almost to be alive again, while we talked of her.&nbsp; 
Tearful smiles often brightened their countenances, as they heard
the voice of friendship uttering their daughter&rsquo;s praises; 
or rather the praises of Him who had made her a vessel of mercy, 
and an instrument of spiritual good to her family.</p>
<p>The time for departing was now at hand.</p>
<p>I went to take my last look at the deceased.&nbsp; There was 
much written on her countenance.&nbsp; <!-- page 116--><a 
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>She had 
evidently died with a smile.&nbsp; It still remained, and spoke 
the tranquillity of her soul.&nbsp; According to the custom of 
the country, she was decorated with leaves and flowers in the 
coffin: she seemed as a bride gone forth to meet the 
bridegroom.&nbsp; These, indeed, were fading flowers, but they 
reminded me of that paradise whose flowers are immortal, and 
where her never-dying soul is at rest.</p>
<p>I remembered the last words which I had heard her speak, and 
was instantly struck with the happy thought that &ldquo;death was
indeed swallowed up in victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I slowly retired, I said inwardly, &ldquo;Peace, my 
honoured sister, be to <i>thy</i> memory and to <i>my</i> soul, 
till we meet in a better world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a little time, the procession formed: it was rendered the 
more interesting by the consideration of so many that followed 
the coffin being persons of a devout and spiritual 
character.&nbsp; The distance was rather more than a mile.&nbsp; 
I resolved to continue with and go before them, as they moved 
slowly onwards.</p>
<p>Immediately after the body came the venerable father and 
mother, <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116" 
class="citation">[116]</a> bending with age, and weeping <!-- 
page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>through much affection of heart.&nbsp; Their appearance
was calculated to excite every emotion of pity, love, and 
esteem.&nbsp; The other relatives followed them in order, and the
several attendant friends took their places behind.</p>
<p>After we had advanced about a hundred yards, my meditation was
unexpectedly and most agreeably <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
118</span>interrupted, by the friends who attended beginning to 
sing a funeral psalm.&nbsp; Nothing could be more sweet or 
solemn.&nbsp; The well-known effect of the open air, in softening
and blending the sounds of music, was here peculiarly felt.&nbsp;
The road through which we passed was beautiful and 
romantic.&nbsp; It lay at the foot <!-- page 119--><a 
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>of a hill, 
which occasionally re-echoed the voices of the singers, and 
seemed to give faint replies to the notes of the mourners.&nbsp; 
The funeral-knell was distinctly heard from the church tower, and
increased the effect which this simple and becoming service 
produced.</p>
<p>We went by several cottages; a respectful attention was 
universally observed as we passed: and the countenances of many 
proclaimed their regard for the departed young woman.&nbsp; The 
singing was regularly continued, with occasional intervals of 
about five minutes, during our whole progress.</p>
<p>I cannot describe the state of my own mind as peculiarly 
connected with this solemn singing.&nbsp; I never witnessed a 
similar instance before or since.&nbsp; I was reminded of elder 
times and ancient piety.&nbsp; I wished the practice more 
frequent.&nbsp; It seems well calculated to excite and cherish 
devotion and religious affections.</p>
<p>Music, when judiciously brought into the service of religion, 
is one of the most delightful, and not least efficacious means of
grace.&nbsp; I pretend not too minutely to conjecture as to the 
actual nature of those pleasures which, after the resurrection, 
the reunited body and soul will enjoy in heaven; but I can hardly
persuade myself that melody and harmony will be wanting, <!-- 
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
120</span>when even the sense of hearing shall itself be 
glorified.</p>
<p>We arrived at the church.&nbsp; The service was heard with 
deep and affectionate attention.&nbsp; When we came to the grave,
the hymn which Elizabeth had selected was sung.&nbsp; All was 
devout, simple, animating.&nbsp; We committed our dear 
sister&rsquo;s body to the earth, in full hope of a joyful 
resurrection.</p>
<p>Thus was the veil of separation drawn for a season.&nbsp; She 
is departed, and no more seen, but she will be seen on the right 
hand of her Redeemer at the last day; and will again appear to 
his glory, a miracle of grace and a monument of mercy.</p>
<p>My reader, rich or poor, shall you and I appear there 
likewise?&nbsp; Are we &ldquo;clothed with humility,&rdquo; and 
arrayed in the wedding-garment of a Redeemer&rsquo;s 
righteousness?&nbsp; Are we turned from idols to serve the living
God?&nbsp; Are we sensible of our own emptiness, and therefore 
flying to a Saviour&rsquo;s fulness to obtain grace and 
strength?&nbsp; Do we indeed live in Christ, and on Him, and by 
Him, and with Him?&nbsp; Is He our all in all?&nbsp; Are we 
&ldquo;lost and found,&rdquo; &ldquo;dead and alive 
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My <i>poor</i> reader, the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter was a 
<i>poor</i> girl, and the child of a <i>poor</i> man.&nbsp; 
Herein <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>thou resemblest her; but dost thou 
resemble <i>her</i> as she resembled Christ?&nbsp; Art thou made 
rich by faith?&nbsp; Hast thou a crown laid up for thee?&nbsp; Is
thine heart set upon heavenly riches?&nbsp; If not, read this 
story once more, and then pray earnestly for like precious 
faith?</p>
<p>But if, through grace, thou dost love and serve the Redeemer 
that saved the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, grace, peace, and mercy
be with thee!&nbsp; The lines are fallen unto thee in pleasant 
places! thou hast a goodly heritage.&nbsp; Press forward in duty,
and wait upon the Lord, possessing thy soul in holy 
patience.&nbsp; Thou hast just been with me to the grave of a 
departed believer.&nbsp; Now, &ldquo;go thy way, till the end be;
for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the 
days.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Footnotes:</h2>
<p><a name="footnote116"></a><a href="#citation116" 
class="footnote">[116]</a>&nbsp; An interesting account of a 
visit made to the Dairyman, appeared in the <i>Christian 
Guardian</i> for October 1813, and which is here 
inserted:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has rarely, if ever, fallen to my lot to trace the 
gracious dealing of God with greater advantage or delight, than 
in the narrative of the Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter: and as the 
Isle of Wight had evidently furnished the author with the scenery
he has so finely touched, I concluded that the pious subject of 
the little memoir had resided there, and determined that, when I 
next visited that delightful spot, I would make inquiry 
respecting her.&nbsp; At the close of April last year, I had 
occasion to go there.&nbsp; At the village of B--- I had the good
fortune to learn her name, and the situation of the cottage that 
had been honoured with her residence and death; and being told 
that the old man, her father, whose name is W---, still lived 
there, I determined to find out his humble dwelling, and obtain 
an interview with the aged Dairyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was with feelings not to be described that I visited
the spot which had been so peculiarly honoured by the gracious 
presence of the Most High.&nbsp; On inquiry, I found that 
Elizabeth W--- died about eleven years ago; that her mother 
followed her in the same year; that one of her brothers (whom I 
did not see) lived in the same cottage; and that her father was 
about eighty years of age.&nbsp; The venerable old man appeared 
to wonder at the feelings of a stranger, but seemed thankful for 
my visit, and wept as I made past scenes again pass before his 
view.&nbsp; I was happy to find that his hopes were built upon 
the Rock of Ages; that his sure trust was in the Redeemer of 
sinners.&nbsp; We talked of the kind attentions of the Rev. Mr 
---, of the happy death of Elizabeth, of the wondrous grace of 
God; and when I bade him farewell, and reminded him how soon he 
would again see his daughter, not, indeed, encompassed with 
infirmity, and depressed with disease, but &ldquo;shining as the 
sun in the firmament,&rdquo; the poor old man wept plentifully, 
and little would he be to be envied who could have 
refrained.&nbsp; I looked back on the cottage until it could no 
longer be seen, and then went on my way rejoicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third of November last, being again in that 
district, I had the pleasure of repeating my visit to the good 
old Dairyman, who immediately recollected me.&nbsp; He told me 
many persons had been to see him since my former call, but he 
believed they were strangers, not inhabitants of the 
island.&nbsp; He appeared much weaker than before, and evidently 
drawing nearer to his rest.&nbsp; Whether he is still living, I 
know not; but it is probable I shall see him no 
more.&rdquo;&mdash;The pious old Dairyman lived three years after
this visit: he departed in the hope of meeting his gracious 
Redeemer.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
